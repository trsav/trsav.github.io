    "text": "Killing Thatcher - Rory Carroll\nMaggie‚Äôs potential assassin, ironically named Magee is presented as someone who can‚Äôt catch a break. He has a troubled relationship with his wife, is arrested countless times, and it goes without saying, didn‚Äôt kill Thatcher.\nCarroll‚Äôs detailed account of his whereabouts in England are interspersed with Magee‚Äôs own reflections later on in life, which are characteristically dry: ‚Äúmy life was too chaotic‚Äù. Carroll does well to chip away and reveal a portrait of a man who presented himself deliberately dull enough that no one seems to remember what he looks like (useful if you have attempted to assassinate a sitting prime minister). The bleak reality of being an anonymous IRA operative in England is contrasted with the historical implications of the task at hand. Guy Faulks planted a bomb under the Houses of Parliament that didn‚Äôt even go off, and people burn an effigy of him every year. The events of the book seem surreal to those born after the troubles; ‚Äúone of the great what ifs‚Äù that Thatcher herself rarely chose to comprehend.\nCarroll dwells on the turning points of the era, such as the death of Bobby Sands and the rise of Gerry Adams‚Äô Armalite / Ballot Box strategy, providing the relevant context for someone unfamiliar with the period. However, by focussing largely on the ‚ÄòEngland Department‚Äô and specifically a single operation, these public-facing protagonists are side-lined in favour of a different type of history. One that is populated with normal people: students, office workers and landlords. These accounts provide important insight into the human cost of the troubles on both sides. Light relief comes somewhat unsurprisingly not from the members of the IRA (and Gerry Adams), but from the British detectives charged with locating Magee. The tangle of regional agencies searching for Magee as he drifts throughout the UK, whose jurisdiction changes every other page, results in a thrilling chase of comically bureaucratic proportions.\nMaybe it‚Äôs too soon for a screen adaptation of these events, Carroll has been sensitive with his accounts and sources (with obvious reason), and wounds are still fresh, particularly those of Thatcher‚Äôs then ‚Äúloyal enforcer‚Äù Norman Tebbit whose wife was paralysed by the attempt. However, the book is an account of a major event in modern British history that is genuinely hard to put down. Following the success of The Crown with its relentless march from the past to the present, and the Happy Valley genre of regional crime drama, Killing Thatcher has all the hallmarks of a hit series. Regardless of how people judge the event, Carroll has provided a valuable account, to remember."

    "text": "Gazza Agonistes - Ian Hamilton\nThere is no discernible anniversary associated to this review of Gazza Agonistes. The book was first published 29 years ago and describes the events surrounding the life of footballer Paul Gascoigne throughout the 1990s. The author, literary critic and poet Ian Hamilton passed away in 2001. However, his depiction of the rise and fall of a talented man is timeless and universal. Hamilton writes from the perspective of a lifelong fan, willing Gazza up the field from behind the pen, a ‚Äòself-styled Gazzamane‚Äô. He celebrates the highs with literary flourish, and reports on the lows with all the authority of a disapproving parent.\nI was first made aware of Gazza Agonistes via a series of recent tweets showing footballers gracing the covers of the London Review of Books throughout the 1980s, with titles such as ‚ÄòSocial democracy, Sociology, Soccer‚Äô. Karl Miller, the editor at the time pioneered as the Guardian put in his obituary, ‚Äòa distinguished style of soccer journalism‚Äô. Gazza Agonistes is perfectly placed within this subgenre and seems so far away from the current state of football critique, consisting largely of Mark Goldbridge looking sad.\nWriting in 1994 (with a 1998 afterword written after Gazza‚Äôs exclusion from the World Cup squad that year), Hamilton describes being attracted to Gazza‚Äôs ‚Äúlegendary scampers‚Äù whilst at he played for his childhood club Newcastle, later moving to Tottenham, Hamilton‚Äôs childhood club. This transaction of loyalties, from one man‚Äôs sporting allegiances to another, provides Hamilton with the emotional license to report on Gazza in a way that is distinct from the tabloid journalists that plague the footballer‚Äôs career.\nGazza Agonistes highlights just how much the culture of football has changed throughout the last 20 years. Players were expected to take accountability for their own actions; justifications for drunken nights were laundered by the tabloids and aired out to dry in the court of public opinion. The concept of the beautiful game seemed much more tangible when those involved talked and behaved just like those watching in the stands. Gazza would go to the pub with his mates like us, end up in fights like us, and famously shed a tear like us. There is an argument against this level of scrutiny. It destroyed Paul Gascoigne; why should people earning a living have to answer for their actions outside of their work?\nFor better or for worse, player engagements on social media and with journalists are now heavily vetted. Clubs don‚Äôt want to risk anything that could undermine their own image, and in turn their net worth. Owners are looking to sell at reputational highs, whilst fans want owners to leave when their clubs are at their lowest. Who knows what Hamilton would think of the players who are expected to answer for nation-states, and how the Gazza of then would respond to allegations of sports-washing.\nGazza Agonistes is a reminder of a simpler, more passionate footballing time; best enjoyed whilst listening to the soundtrack of the 1990 Italian World Cup Nessun Dorma. For all of Gazza‚Äôs mistakes, and the treatment he endured, his epic struggles will not be repeated any time soon, and neither will an account as poetic as Hamilton‚Äôs."
