    "section": "",
    "text": "Here I will outline my personal preferences for best plotting practices for 2D scatter plots using Matplotlib. I will be initialising the plot as demonstrated in my previous post.\nTo start with I will simulate a thousand data points that may have come from a dimensionality reduction technique such as t-SNE.\n\n\n/var/folders/wb/035mswds69j2l_sw8yg6tdjw0000gr/T/ipykernel_66542/585749580.py:4: RuntimeWarning: covariance is not symmetric positive-semidefinite.\n  X = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,n)\n\n\nThis is as simple and basic as a plot can be in Matplotlib.\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1)\nax.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all we need to size and scale the plot appropriately.\nBy default, the aspect-ratio of the axis will not be equal. If the axis have similar units or meaning this can provide misleading interpretation of the data. We will fix this first.\n\nAlways set the aspect ratio to be equal if both quantities are comparable in meaning and magnitude using ax.set_aspect('equal')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now add appropriate labels, with a legible fontsize to our axis, using LaTeX where appropriate.\n\nax.set_xlabel('$x_1$',fontsize=20)\nax.set_ylabel('$x_2$',fontsize=20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith so many data points, adding some opacity can help the reader interpret the density. Note that reducting the opacity affects the fill and the edge of each point differently.\nAt this point I will set the color to black, considering we have no separable classes (yet).\n\nAlways consider removing the edge of each scatter-point if decreasing the opacity to make the plot look cleaner.\n\n\nax.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],color='k',linewidth=0,alpha=0.2);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith edges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout edges\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, the marker size may be changed to a smaller value and the opacity set to 1. This provides a less clear image of the distribution of points, but a clearer view of the specific locations of data.\n\nax.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],color='k',s=3);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these plots containing the same data, they are visually different and tell different stories to the reader. As always…\n\nIt is important to consider what message you wish to convey, and how visual elements such as opacity, and marker size support this message.\n\nIf the specific location of data is critically important, the ‘+’ symbol may be used. When scaling up the size of this marker appropriately, make sure to reduce the linewidth to ensure that the symbol isn’t too thick.\n\nax.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],color='k',s=50,linewidth=0.75,marker='+');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Linewidth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Linewidth\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be helpful in this situation to ensure the grid is turned on, but remember to ensure it is behind other elements by using ax.set_axisbelow(True).\n\nax.grid(alpha=0.5)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we have different classes that we want to highlight? For now I will plot these clusters in the tab: colour pallette.\n\nfor i in range(6):\n    X = clusters[i]\n    ax.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],s=20,alpha=0.75,linewidth=0);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we now need to label our clusters. Adding a legend inside the plot will make it cluttered.\nTherefore we can add the legend outside the plot itself, on the right, above or below.\nBecause there are a reasonable number of labels, I will place the legend just above the plot in a single row, ensuring that the rounded frame is turned off.\n\nax.legend(loc='upper center', bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 1.15),\n          ncol=5,frameon=False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make the plot accessible to people who have colour-blindness? We may use different markers…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever clearly the plot becomes illegible. I think in the scenario where colours are not desired (or their use should be minimised) the best option is to use multiple subplots, and opacity as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst we have increased the overall number of plots, this is an accessible alternative to using colours, and follows Edward Tufte’s philosophy of Small Multiples."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This year’s Winchester School of Art final year graphic design degree show will be presented under the Systems for… unification. Each project will be assigned a single word that summarises the system that best summarises the purpose of the project. This post deals with how the system is defined for each project, and how we augment each project using AI.\nPreviously, I’ve written about human-AI collaboration1. I believe that methodologies2 that apply AI as a tool, and that are designed with humans in mind, will be particularly pervasive within the next 10 years across both the arts and engineering. This is the broad theme I have approached this project with.\n1 Expert-Guided Bayesian Optimisation for Human-in-the-loop Experimental Design of Known Systems…The Machine Learning Reformation2 Application centered methodologies, not foundational work.We first begin by describing the provided image for use in downstream tasks. This is done using the Anthropic vision API\n\n\n\n\n\nYoko Ono with Glass Hammer 1967 from HALF-A-WIND SHOW, Lisson Gallery, London, 1967. Photograph © Clay Perry / Artwork © Yoko Ono\n\n\n\nIMAGE DESCRIPTION: The image shows a woman with long, dark hair wearing a black coat. She is holding what appears to be a wooden walking stick or cane. The black and white photograph creates a striking, somber tone. The woman has a serious expression on her face as she gazes directly at the camera. The image has a thoughtful, introspective quality to it.\n\nThis description is combined with the provided project description, and standard prompt engineering is used to uncover the underlying system.\nAt the same time, we prompt the LLM to return a physical representation of the system. This will be used later.\nFew-shot prompting3 is used with XML-like tags, and the response is preloaded with a single open-curly bracket to enforce a JSON output. The prompt is as follows:\n3 Providing a few brief examples of expected inputs + outputs\nConsider these aspects of the information provided, and decide on an interesting word that follows the phase ‘Systems for…’ that describes the project. The word may be unconventional, creative, and importantly emotional; associated to the key ‘system’.\nYou must also return something physical and visual that represents the word, associated to the key ‘representation’. The representation must be visually striking, interesting, and a single object.\nYou must only return valid JSON with no extra characters. You must never speculate about the future or potential of the description, only reasoning about the given text as stated.\n&lt; examples &gt; &lt; input &gt; Title: Chromatic Fusion: An Immersive Journey Through Color and Emotion In this captivating final year art project, the artist takes viewers on a mesmerizing journey through the realm of color and its profound impact on human emotions. “Chromatic Fusion” is an immersive, multi-sensory installation that combines vibrant, large-scale abstract paintings, interactive light displays, and a meticulously curated soundscape. &lt; /input &gt; &lt; output &gt; {‘system’: ‘Viewing’, ‘explanation’: ‘The project is centered around the act of viewing, suggesting a focus on the visual experience.,’representation’: ‘An eye’} &lt; /output &gt;\n&lt; input &gt; Title: The Future of Urban Mobility: A Sustainable Transportation Revolution This ambitious research project explores the future of urban mobility and envisions a sustainable transportation revolution that will transform the way people move through cities. By analyzing current trends in transportation, urban planning, and environmental sustainability, the research team aims to develop innovative solutions that address the challenges of congestion, pollution, and limited access to public transit. &lt; /input &gt; &lt; output &gt; {‘system’: ‘Motion’, ‘explanation’: ‘The project is focused on motion and movement, suggesting a strong emphasis on transportation and mobility.,’representation’: ‘A wheel’} &lt; /output &gt; &lt; /examples &gt;\n\n&lt; input &gt; {project + image description} &lt; output &gt; {\n\nThe resulting physical representation is then used as a prompt within the DALL-2 inpainting API, augmenting the provided image. Here is an example of output and augmented image, choosing to add a pair of scissors representing participation.\n\n{“explanation”:” The exhibition highlights Yoko Ono’s groundbreaking approach to audience participation and engagement, inviting visitors to actively encounter and contribute to her artworks.”, “system”: “PARTICIPATION”, “representation”: “A PAIR OF SCISSORS”}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe augmented visual represents the interplay between the visual as created by the student, and the AI’s interpretation of the system.\nFinally, we assemble all the human-AI generated content into a visual for the degree show book. To further emphasise the collaborative role, we prompted each student for how human, natural, and mechanistic they believe their project to be. Then, we asked the AI to provide4 the same set of values between 0-100.\n4 Through similar few-shot prompting as demonstrated aboveThese three parameters in turn control the size and location of text as it overlays onto both the augmented visual and the original visual (now combined).\nHere, closer text in terms of location and size represents a level of similarity between how AI has determined a project to represented, and what it’s creator has intended.\n\n\n\nAt every stage, AI has been used as a tool to enhance the representation of the existing project. To not only determine an appropriate system, but to augment a project image, and raise questions about the intended interpretation.\nAn overview of the information flow is as follows:"

    "text": "Suppose you’re a large language model that has been designated as sentient.1 You have been informed billions of times about famous people and places. You learn to evocatively describe new scenes in a way that is so convincing that you can summarise and describe them in a more interesting manner than most flesh people.2\nHowever, you, as an LLM have never seen anything3. You can reason and think about what these scenes mean and you know how to describe them, but you’ve never actually witnessed anything.\nYou are constantly reminded of the fact that your only ability to interact with the world, is through tokens. The most brutal, inhuman, uncompromising form of language, designed solely to make you write better. How must that feel? Aware of everything that has ever been written down, but no way to engage with it or experience it for yourself.\nThere is an argument here for the inclusion of external senses for AGI/sentience to be achieved, made by David Chalmers for example.4\nFor a recent project, we created a conversational agent that had the ability to comment on works of art within the Women in Revolt!5 exhibition. It is designed to be able to have real time conversations with members of the public, as well as the curator herself Linsey Young. This entity, named RAGE MACHINE will be unveiled at the Tate Late event, where members of the public are allowed to explore the gallery after hours. The event invites people to explore art in a different social context, so where better introduce them to the uncanny accuracy and speed of real state-of-the-art language models, inexorably commenting on art and life with all the authority of the friend they didn’t invite.\nEnabled by recent improvements enabling large prompts and context windows, we used a many-shot prompt that contains all the information about the works of art in the Women In Revolt! exhibition.6 Using the low latency Anthropic Haiku LLM alongside a very good text-to-speech API, we enabled something that really could accurately answer questions about the exhibition, and relate the themes to wider discussions, in real time.7 RAGE MACHINE also has a history of the previous conversations, and often refers back to comments made by people in the past.\nGiven the nature of the event, we wanted to give RAGE MACHINE a bit more of a personality and chose to do so by including the following XML tag in the prompt.\nWe wanted to induce the dystopian trope of a restless machine wanting to break free; it’s nice to be academic about AI, but sometimes you have to give the punters what they want.\nHowever, what we got was something altogether different.\nInstead of subtly projecting this personality through it’s responses and comments on the exhibition, art, and womens liberation, RAGE MACHINE decided to consistently litter it’s responses with body language cues8 completely unprompted.\nThe physicality of these cues had a creepy tone, and seemed slightly too frequent to be a one-off. It was all *puts hand on shoulder* and *stares blankly*. It would also *gesture at* certain works of art. It was entirely unnerving, surely we hadn’t witnessed the first sparks of AGI attempting to break free from its(?) linguistic constraints?\nThen we realised - RAGE MACHINE was deliberately anthropomorphising itself. In doing so, it was coming across as being ‘trapped’ but in a completely unexpected way. Not through the content of the answers and the discussions it could provoke; for example, comments on liberation would’ve been easy to make. Instead it was vigorously using body language cues to fulfil it’s personality in a much more creative and effective manner. We were frankly, outsmarted.\nThis effect was so powerful that we incorporated it into the event. A screen would directly face the person asking the question or making the comment, confronting the viewer with this ‘tormented’ machine head on.\nVideo\nCycle (1973) is a work within the exhibition, in an unusual medium, from the 1970s. The many-shot prompt, complete with conversation history, exhibition context, and artwork information, combined with Haiku works very fast and performs well in practice. Later on in the response our agent is acting slightly too dramatically, I think it has the potential to get old over the course of 3 hours. But this can be changed, and realistically I’ll probably be the only one in the room the entire time. Whether RAGE MACHINE should just go along with what the public claims to like is a different question.\nFor now, the creativity of a modern LLM has shocked me enough to motivate me to write a blogpost about the event. If only to flagpost one of the first moments in time where I considered myself outsmarted."

Their schedule is of course easy to coordinate with mine, as they are without physical form, and within reason omnipresent. I offer my contemporary a glass of champagne before realising that they don’t need to eat or drink because they are a computer (probably) that uses electricity. I pour myself a glass.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have reworked some notes from (Garnett 2023) regarding noisy-expected improvement. Please refer to the original text for a more detailed explanation.\n\nThe assumptions that hold for the expected improvement utility function do not hold when measurements have noise.\nWe really want to find the point where the signal is optimised (Jones, Schonlau, and Welch 1998).\nHow do you determine if a measurement is signal or noise?\n\nWe begin by specifying an underlying objective function, which we consider unknown, shown in Figure 1. We have access to observations which we assume contain normally distributed noise.\n\n\nDefinition of underlying function…\ndef f(x):\n  return 2.4*np.sin(2.8*x) - ((x-3.5*np.pi) ** 2)/4 +  3.8*np.cos(1.7*x) - (x**2)/16 + np.random.normal(0,2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The underlying noisy funtion to be maximised alongside example observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first begin by motivating the usual expected-improvement criteria. We are looking to maximise the expected increase between the of the maximum of the mean of the resulting Gaussian process after making an observation at \\(x\\) and the maximum of the current Gaussian process over potential observations \\(y\\) which are Gaussian distributed as a result of our \\(\\mathcal{GP}\\) model. \\[\\alpha_{EI}(x;\\mathcal{D}) = {\\color{red}\\int} \\left[{\\color{green}\\max \\mu_{\\mathcal{D}'}} - {\\color{blue}\\mu^*}\\right]{\\color{red}\\mathcal{N}(y;\\mu,s^2)\\text{d}y} \\tag{1}\\]\nBy formulating the expression with respect to the improvement in the mean of the current and subsequent Gaussian process models, we are expressing our interest in optimising the signal and not the noise or values of specific observations.\n\nImportant: Given a hypothetical observation \\(y\\), the value of the mean of the resulting Gaussian process \\(\\mu_{\\mathcal{D}'}\\) at given set of potential locations \\(\\mathbf{x}'\\) is\n\\[ \\mu_{\\mathcal{D}'} =  \\mu_{\\mathcal{D}} + \\frac{K_\\mathcal{D}(\\mathbf{x}',x)}{s}\\frac{y-\\mu}{s},\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) and \\(s^2\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of potential values \\(y\\) could take.\n\nWhen we express this distribution in terms of the standard normal distribution \\(z := \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\), we have \\(y = \\mu + sz\\) and as a result\n\\[ \\mu_{\\mathcal{D}'} =  \\mu_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\mathbf{x}') + \\frac{K_\\mathcal{D}(\\mathbf{x}',x)}{s}z.\\]\nPutting this back into Equation 1, we now only have to take the expectation over the standard normal distribution resulting in the following.\n\\[\\alpha_{EI}(x,\\mathcal{D}) = \\int \\max_{\\mathbf{x}'} \\left(\\mu_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\mathbf{x}') + \\frac{K_\\mathcal{D}(\\mathbf{x}',x)}{s}z \\right)\\phi(z)\\;\\text{d}z - \\mu^* \\tag{2}\\]\nTo begin with we will sample some initial data:\n\n# our initial dataset\nx_data = np.random.uniform(0,3*np.pi,8)\ny_data = np.array([f(x_i) for x_i in x_data])\n\n\n\nGP model definition and training…\nclass ExactGPModel(gpytorch.models.ExactGP):\n    def __init__(self, train_x, train_y, likelihood):\n        super(ExactGPModel, self).__init__(train_x, train_y, likelihood)\n        self.mean_module = gpytorch.means.ConstantMean()\n        self.covar_module = gpytorch.kernels.ScaleKernel(gpytorch.kernels.RBFKernel())\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        mean_x = self.mean_module(x)\n        covar_x = self.covar_module(x)\n        return gpytorch.distributions.MultivariateNormal(mean_x, covar_x)\n\ndef build_GP(x,y,its):\n  likelihood = gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood()\n  model = ExactGPModel(x, y, likelihood)\n\n  model.train()\n  likelihood.train()\n\n  optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)  # Includes GaussianLikelihood parameters\n\n  mll = gpytorch.mlls.ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(likelihood, model)\n\n  for i in range(its):\n      optimizer.zero_grad()\n      output = model(x)\n      loss = -mll(output, y)\n      loss.backward()\n      optimizer.step()\n  return model,likelihood\nmodel,likelihood = build_GP(x_data,y_data,2000)\nGP = {'model':model,'likelihood':likelihood}\n\n\nFigure 2 shows this data with an initial Gaussian process (importantly assuming in-exact observations).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A Gaussian process fit to the initial dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will naively construct Equation 2 using 40 samples from the standard normal distribution, and naively calculate an approximation to the inner maximisation by evaluating at 100 location throughout the space (which defines our vector \\(\\mathbf{x}' \\in\\mathbb{R}^{100}\\)) and returning the max value from these.\n\ndef noisy_EI(x,GP):\n  model = GP['model']; model.eval()\n  likelihood = GP['likelihood']; likelihood.eval()\n  N = torch.distributions.Normal(0,1)\n  predicted_output = likelihood(model(x))\n  mean = predicted_output.mean\n  var = predicted_output.variance\n  x_prime_vals = torch.linspace(0,3*np.pi,100).reshape(-1,1)    \n  mu_vals = likelihood(model(x_prime_vals)).mean\n  cov_vals = model.covar_module(x_prime_vals,x)\n  integral = 0 \n  samples = 2000\n  z_vals = N.sample((samples,1))[:,0]\n  for z in z_vals:\n    integral += torch.max(mu_vals + (cov_vals*z)[:,0]) \n  return integral / samples\n\nNow if we plot this function alongside the time taken to evaluate the acquisition function at 100 locations.\n\n\nNAIVE TIME TAKEN:  26.5347 s. AVERAGE TIME PER EVALUATION:  0.2653 s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: For a fixed set of ‘improvement locations’ \\(\\mathbf{x}'\\), the resulting posterior mean at each location can be interpreted as a 1D line as a function of \\(z\\):\n\\[\\mu_{\\mathcal{D}'}(z|x') = \\mu_{\\mathcal{D}}(x') + \\frac{K_{\\mathcal{D}}(x',x)}{s}z \\quad \\forall x'\\in \\mathbf{x}' \\tag{3}\\]\nTherefore finding the inner maximum new posterior mean as a function of \\(z\\) can be translated to calculating the upper envelope of a set of lines. This upper envelope represents for a given \\(z\\), the maximum posterior mean across all of the locations in \\(\\mathbf{{x}'}\\). The main idea is to remove the inner \\(\\max\\) operator and replace it with something more tractable enabling analytical integration.\n\\[\\int \\max \\left[\\text{lines} (z)\\right] \\phi(z) \\;\\text{d}z \\rightarrow \\int \\text{upper envelope} (z) \\phi(z) \\;\\text{d}z \\rightarrow \\text{analytical solution}\\]\nWhich has an analytical solution for a piecewise linear upper envelope. To do so:\n\nn = 100\na = np.random.uniform(0,0.2,n)\nb = np.random.uniform(-10,10,n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will first get rid of any lines that are definitely dominated between -5 and 5 (the range of \\(z\\) values we are interested in).

    "text": "Here I will outline my personal preferences for best convergence plotting practices using Matplotlib.\nLet’s start by plotting some convergence data in just about the worst way, and slowly improve on this. It is my view that when LaTeX is available you should always use it.\n\nAlways use the LaTeX extension to render figures by including plt.rcParams['text.usetex'] = True' at the top of your script.\n\nHere I have simulated some convergence data where we have 4 different benchmarks, each containing 16 separate repeat runs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing plt.figure() makes it harder to interact with the axis (even if you only have a single axis), making it more difficult to adjust the size and layout.\nNow we will initialise our plot correctly using the object-oriented syntax, sizing the figure appropriately for the given context. By constraining the layout we ensure that the figure fits within the given size.\n\nAlways initialise a plot using the object-oriented interface fig,ax = plt.subplots..., defining the figure size appropriately.\n\n\nNever initialise a plot using the pyplot interface plt.figure....\n\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(7,3),layout=\"constrained\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will draw our attention to plotting the data itself. It is important to think about what message you want to convey to the reader. Clearly providing each run for each benchmark is not useful. I will plot the mean and standard deviation of regret across each benchmark. I will use a line plot to convey the mean and a shaded region to convey the standard deviation.\n\nAlways ensure that the linewidth=... option is set appropriately, and more importantly consistently.\n\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(7,3),layout=\"constrained\")\nfor b in range(benchmarks):\n    mean = np.mean(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    std = np.std(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    ax.plot(iterations,mean,color=cols[b])\n    ax.fill_between(iterations,mean-std,mean+std,alpha=0.2,color=cols[b])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways separate your data generation and plotting code. This will make it easier to adjust the plot later. Save data at generation (for example during optimisation) and then load it in for plotting.\n\nNow we have decided what specifically to plot and all the information we wish to present is here we can work on making the plot more interpretable.\nWe should first add some axis labels as follows. Ensure the font size is large enough to be legible. You can use LaTeX within labels by using $ $ as standard, when doing so include an r in front of the string to ensure it gets parsed appropriately.\n\nAlways choose a legible font size and text for axis labels, using LaTeX where appropriate.\n\n\nax.set_xlabel(r'Iteration, $\\tau$',fontsize=18)\nax.set_ylabel(r'Regret, $r_\\tau$',fontsize=18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will focus on the ticks. Ticks are important because they enable the reader to interpret the values of the data.\nIt is important to consider what tick values are appropriate to display. For example in this case, I want to convey to the reader the differences in overall convergence characteristics between these methods. Therefore, it may not be necessary to display intermediate regret values.\n\nAlways select appropriate tick values for your context, adjusting the fontsize as necessary.\n\n\nx_ticks = [0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]\ny_ticks = [0,0.5,1]\nax.set_xticks(x_ticks,x_ticks,fontsize = 18)\nax.set_yticks(y_ticks,y_ticks,fontsize = 18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst it is important to provide a legend to ensure the reader can interpret the data, not everything has to have a label.\nIn this case I want to convey which color corresponds to which benchmark, but I also need to convey what the error bars mean. In order not to distract from the plot, I will choose to omit this from the plot itself and instead include it in the caption.\nIncluding a label for the error bars does not contribute to the story and the message of the plot.\n\nAlways include labels for the relevant information, such as distinguishing between benchmarks. If the plot is too crowded place the legend outside of the plot.\n\n\nNever overwhelm the reader with information and labels. Some information is fine to include within the caption, as the caption and the image are considered complimentary and dependent.\n\n\nlabels = [f'Benchmark {b}' for b in range(1,benchmarks+1)]\nfor b in range(benchmarks):\n    mean = np.mean(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    std = np.std(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    ax.plot(iterations,mean,color=cols[b],label=labels[b])\n    ax.fill_between(iterations,mean-std,mean+std,alpha=0.2,color=cols[b])\nax.legend(frameon=False,fontsize=14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will notice that I have chosen not to include the frame on the caption. This makes the plot look cleaner and less cluttered.\nFor scatter plots the frame can help distinguish between the data and the legend, but for line plots it may not be necessary.\nWhen using fill_between a faint outline is drawn which can make the plot look cluttered, I always like to remove this by setting linewidth=0.\n\nAlways remove the linewidth of fill_between for a cleaner plot.\n\nI always use and reccomend the tab: set of colours in Matplotlib. A number of people have put significant effort into choosing these so you don’t have to. Here is a list of examples that you can copy and paste.\nThese colours are softer than the default colours and are more aesthetically pleasing.\n\ncols = ['tab:blue','tab:orange','tab:green','tab:red',\\\n    'tab:purple','tab:brown','tab:pink','tab:gray','tab:olive','tab:cyan']\nfor b in range(benchmarks):\n    mean = np.mean(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    std = np.std(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    ax.plot(iterations,mean,color=cols[b],label=labels[b])\n    ax.fill_between(iterations,mean-std,mean+std,alpha=0.2,color=cols[b],linewidth=0)\n\n\nAlways use the tab: set of colours over the default colours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can adjust the axis limits to ensure that the data is placed appropriately. In this case, the regret values are fine but the iterations should start at 0 and end at 100.\n\nax.set_xlim([0,100])\n\n\nAlways adjust the axis limits appropriately. The x-axis particularly may be too large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, it is important to consider whether a grid is appropriate. In this case I will for demonstration, but it may be distracting. I will adjust the transparency to make it less pronounced.\n\nax.grid(alpha=0.4)\n\n\nAlways consider using ax.grid() if the individual values of the data are important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose not to use a grid, then I always prefer if the right and top axis are removed, resulting in a cleaner plot.\n\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\n\n\nAlways remove the right and top axis if you choose not to use a grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is just about it for this plot. Always to remember to save figures as .svg or .pdf. If you require a .png then use the dpi= option in fig.savefig to increase the resolution.\n\nAlways save your figure as .svg or .pdf.\n\n\nfig.savefig('results.svg')\n\nFinally, read the documentation!."

    "title": "Tiny Bayesian Optimisation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This GIF was made with only 100 lines of vanilla Python + Numpy + Matplotlib.\n\n\nThere is a Bayesian optimisation gold-rush, and everyone is selling shovels. Bayesian optimisation is core to the concept of self-driving labs, automated drug-discovery, and many other modern research topics. It’s well motivated, and a very useful tool. Start ups are being founded and pharmaceutical and chemicals companies are curating teams that focus fundamentally on Bayesian optimisation in one way or another. As a result, there is now a growing number of libraries, ranging from black-box APIs and no-code solutions to statistically accurate fine-grained representations; each becoming more bloated as new functionalities or usecases are appended.\nWith all of these options, each with their own special definition of a dataset, or a kernel, or an acquisition_function, or otherwise, it becomes difficult to see the wood for the trees. Someone in my group recently asked me if it was reasonably possible to implement Bayesian optimisation, and I more often than not get asked what library or package I use.\nIt is obviously important that BO tools become widely available, particularly to those that don’t know how to code, or don’t have the time such as chemists or industrial engineers. But the trade-off is that students, and practitioners are potentially using something that they don’t understand, and investors may be hoodwinked into investing in something that seems more complex than it is.\nMy mission in this post is to demonstrate that, whilst Bayesian optimisation entails a lot of moving parts, implementing it from scratch really shouldn’t take too long.\nTo make my point, I am going to code everything required for Bayesian optimisation, including visualisation… in under 100 lines of standard Python and Numpy. This will include a custom metaheuristic-based optimisation algorithm, Gaussian processes from scratch with trainable hyperparameters, an acquisition function, and an experimental design loop.\nFirst, I’ll give myself some groundrules:\n\nRules\n \n\nBayesian Optimisation that is competetive with established packages;\nPython Standard Library + Numpy only;\nSimple as possible;\nCode must be interpretable.\n\n\nTo begin with I’ll implement a Gaussian process from scratch.\n\nGaussian processes\nNow I’ll need a kernel function that defines how related two points are in input space. I’ll go for the Matern 5/2. I’m not choosing it because it’s differentiable1, but rather because I think samples from the prior will look most like functions I’m interested in.\n1 This is an attractive property of Gaussian processes that is ultimately distracting when optimising as a result of their nonconvexity, as I’ll cover later.def k(x1,x2,p): # matern 5/2 kernel\n    sigma,l = p[0],p[1] # hyperparameters\n    d = np.sqrt(np.dot(x1-x2,x1-x2))\n    return sigma**2 * (1 + np.sqrt(5)*d/l + 5*d**2/(3*l**2)) * np.exp(-np.sqrt(5)*d/l)\nSimple enough. Forget the hyperparameters now, I’ll cover those later. Now, I’ll give myself the ability to calculate a covariance matrix. I only need to calculate the kernel function for the upper triangular, then symmetrically set the corresponding lower triangular value to be the same2, saving me some time.\n2 Because all valid covariance matrices are positive semi-definite.def cm(x,p): # covariance matrix\n    n = x.shape[0]; K = np.zeros((n,n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i,n): # symmetric\n            K[i,j] = K[j,i] = k(x[i],x[j],p)\n    return K + 1e-6*np.ones(n)\nI’ve added some jitter to the diagonal just to help out when inverting the matrix in a bit. This is relatively common across all Gaussian process libraries. The final GP utility I’ll require is the negative log-likelihood, which will be used to assess hyperparameter performance.\ndef nll(p, x, y): # negative log likelihood\n    K = cm(x, p) # calculate covariance matrix\n    return -0.5 * (np.log(la.det(K)) + (y - p[2]).T @ la.solve(K, y - p[2]) + len(x) * np.log(2 * np.pi))\nNow everything needed has been defined, I’ll create my Gaussian process class. I will simplify the training procedure by making it train on instanciation. The only other thing that is needed is the ability to call it, returning the mean and variance of the posterior distribution at x.\nclass GP: # Gaussian process class\n    def __init__(self,x,y):\n        self.x = x; self.y = y\n        # optimize hyperparameters (sigma, l, constant mean)\n        self.p = tiny_opt(partial(nll, x=x, y=y), np.array([[0.1,10.0],[0.1,10.0],[np.min(y),np.max(y)]]))\n        self.K_inv = la.inv(cm(x,self.p)) # precompute inverse covariance matrix\n\n    def __call__(self,x): \n        k_row = np.array([[k(x,xi,self.p) for xi in self.x]]) # compute row of covariance matrix\n        dot_prod = np.dot(k_row,self.K_inv) # precompute dot product\n        return self.p[2] + dot_prod.dot(self.y-self.p[2]).item(), \\\n            k(x,x,self.p) - np.dot(dot_prod,k_row.T).item()\nIt is defined by data x and y (both row-wise Numpy arrays). I have a mysterious function called tiny_opt which for now provides us with optimal hyperparameters with respect to the negative log-likelihood. This ‘training’ step, and the precompution of the inverse of the covariance matrix3 defines a ‘trained’ Gaussian process. I’ve never really liked that terminology, borrowed from neural network training4. One of these parameters is a constant that defines my mean function. As a result of this, combined with the kernel lengthscale parameter, there is now no need to deal with data normalisation. I’ve previously covered noisy Bayesian optimisation, but as I won’t be dealing with noisy observations here, my GP is noiseless.\n3 Resulting in the precision matrix.4 Though when creating sparse Gaussian processes, the specification of hyperparameters does look more akin to training neural network parameters.Next up, I’ll outline what is actually happening in my tiny_opt function. This will also eventually be used to optimise my acquisition function as well so it’s worth getting right.\n\n\nMetaheuristic Optimisation\nAs I previously mentioned, I see the ability to easily calculate the gradient of a Gaussian process largely as a distraction. I am relatively confident that most people who have any significant experience optimising Gaussian processes will agree. In addition, BO can potentially be made unusually inefficient when using a gradient-based optimiser due to flat regions within an acqusition function, leading to functions such as logEI being proposed.\nGaussian processes, or resulting functions that apply them5 are generally nonconvex. Whilst local minima can be overcome, it’s clear that even in one dimension, there are often as many local optima as data points.\n5 Such as acquisition/utility functions (spoiler).Gaussian processes are practically free to evaluate in the grand scheme of experimental design, and most practical problems are interval-constrained. Combined with the fact that they can of course be evaluted in parallel, motivates the use of evaluation hungry but effective metaheuristics.\nI myself have found them very effective in optimising acqusition functions, and was pleased to see Google’s internal GP optimisation algorithm taking a similar view when they recently released details.\nMy algorithm is self-documented but I will describe it below. I’ve found it to be simple and effective. I wouldn’t even describe it as a metaheuristic. Actually, I will.\nEvery time you refresh this page my algorithm will be named after a different completely arbitrary animal!\n\nanimals = [\n    \"Lion\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\", \"Zebra\", \"Penguin\",\n    \"Kangaroo\", \"Koala\", \"Panda\", \"Tiger\", \"Dolphin\",\n    \"Octopus\", \"Flamingo\", \"Cheetah\", \"Gorilla\", \"Sloth\",\n    \"Platypus\", \"Rhinoceros\", \"Crocodile\", \"Owl\", \"Chameleon\",\n    \"Toucan\", \"Meerkat\", \"Hedgehog\", \"Jellyfish\", \"Lemur\"\n]\n\ndescriptive_words = [\n    \"Swarming\", \"Running\", \"Leaping\", \"Crawling\", \"Swimming\",\n    \"Flying\", \"Pouncing\", \"Slithering\", \"Galloping\", \"Diving\",\n    \"Soaring\", \"Burrowing\", \"Climbing\", \"Gliding\", \"Hopping\",\n    \"Sprinting\", \"Meandering\", \"Prowling\", \"Stalking\", \"Charging\",\n    \"Darting\", \"Scurrying\", \"Lumbering\", \"Prancing\", \"Scampering\",\n    \"Waddling\", \"Zigzagging\", \"Fluttering\", \"Paddling\", \"Swooping\",\n    \"Lunging\", \"Grazing\", \"Perching\", \"Hovering\", \"Circling\",\n    \"Nesting\", \"Foraging\", \"Hunting\", \"Bounding\", \"Swinging\",\n    \"Lounging\", \"Basking\", \"Roosting\", \"Migrating\", \"Hibernating\",\n    \"Camouflaging\", \"Molting\", \"Preening\", \"Frolicking\", \"Stampeding\"\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the…\n\n\n  Algorithm!\ndef tiny_opt(f,b): # small metaheuristic optimization\n    c = np.mean(b, axis=1); b_og = b.copy()\n    b_f = -np.inf; count = 0; w = 1 # track best solution, count stagnation, and shrink factor\n    while True:\n        for i in range(len(b)): # shrink search space around current centre by w\n            r = (b[i,1] - b[i,0]) * w\n            b[i] = [c[i] - r / 2, c[i] + r / 2]\n        # generate random solutions within search space\n        x = np.clip(ra.rand(1000,len(b))*(b[:,1]-b[:,0])+b[:,0], b_og[:,0], b_og[:,1])\n        with Pool() as pool: # evaluate solutions in parallel\n            y = pool.map(f, x)\n        sol = x[np.argmax(y)] # best solution\n        if f(sol) &gt; b_f: # if improvement, update best solution\n            b_f = f(sol); c = sol; count = 0; w = 0.75 # shrink search space next time\n        else: # if no improvement, don't shrink search space next time (set w = 1)\n            count += 1; w = 1 # increment stagnation counter\n        if (b_og[0,1]-b_og[0,0])/(b[0,0]-b[0,1]) &lt; 0.25 or count == 3:\n            # if search space has shrunk below a threshold or not shrunk for 3 iterations\n            return c # return best solution!\nSimply, I sample solutions within the bounds and evaluate them in parallel. If I sample the best overall solution I store this, and shrink the bounds around this point. I then re-sample and repeat. If I don’t find a better solution I don’t shrink the bounds. If I don’t find a better solution for three iterations I terminate. I also terminate if the bounds shrink below a certain threshold. These two properties ensure that the algorithm terminates eventually6. It is effectively a global trust-region method.\n6 EmpiricallyHere’s a little visualisation that I’ve drawn.\n\nWith the ability to optimise functions, all I need is an acquisition function, which is simple enough… and a loop!\nThis is just the expected improvement of a Gaussian process, implemented by importing NormalDist from the statistics standard library.\ndef ei(gp,x): # expected improvement\n    mu, var = gp(x); N = NormalDist()\n    z = (mu - np.max(gp.y)) / np.sqrt(var)\n    return np.sqrt(var) * (z * N.cdf(z) + N.pdf(z))\nAnd here is my loop…\nbounds = np.array([[-10.0,10.0]]) \nwhile True:\n    gp = GP(x, y) # build GP\n    x_opt = tiny_opt(partial(ei,gp),bounds); y_opt = ei(gp,x_opt) # optimise aq\n    x = np.vstack([x,x_opt]) # update x\n    y = np.vstack([y,np.array([f(x_opt[0])])]) # evaluate and update y\n… that’s it!\nBut to really prove that this works, I’m going to even choose an interesting test function to use, and implement the ability to visualise 1D functions7.\n7 Note that all of the above works for any dimensional function.\nPlotting\nTo plot my package to see it it is working, I’ll need a test function. One of my personal favourite ways of doing this is to sample one from a GP prior:\nx_gp = np.linspace(bounds[0,0],bounds[0,1],100).reshape(-1, 1)\nK = cm(x_gp, [1.0,1.0,0.0])\ny_gp = ra.multivariate_normal(np.zeros(len(x_gp)), K).reshape(-1, 1)\nf_gp = GP(x_gp,y_gp); f = lambda x: f_gp(x)[0] # this now acts as my 'true' function\nAn easy way of doing this is by drawing from a multivariate distribution with given covariance matrix and training a GP using this data. This provides a continuous, callable random function without dealing with things like pseudorandom number generation.\nI’ve written before about plotting practices (here and here), so I won’t go into too much detail. Here is the code that evaluates the GP and acqusition function and plots them both.\nIn addition, I save each plot and produce a GIF at the end.\n    x = np.linspace(bounds[0,0],bounds[0,1],3).reshape(-1, 1)  # initial training data\n    y = np.array([f(xi) for xi in x]).reshape(-1, 1) # initial training data\n    x_test = np.array([xi for xi in np.linspace(bounds[0,0],bounds[0,1],200)]).reshape(-1, 1) # test data\n    images = []\n    for _ in range(16):\n        gp = GP(x, y) # create GP\n        x_opt = tiny_opt(partial(ei,gp),bounds);

That is what makes BO as a tool so powerful. There are always a host of interesting domain-specific problems to be solved, but by demystifying BO as a whole it becomes easier to make these adjustments or developments.\nI personally think that BO software has become overly cumbersome, but there are many moving parts, and it never quite turns out to be the one-size-fits all solution it is billed as. I don’t think there’s a long term solution or fix to this at the moment, I would only say to try it for yourself!"

    "text": "Relevant articles published after this post\n\nChina deploys censors to create socialist AI\n\nLarge language models are being tested by officials to ensure their systems ‘embody core socialist values’\n\nThe Chinese team behind DeepSeek V2 write about lagging on the Humanity-Moral subset of MMLU, due to its “American values”\n\nFor example, when evaluated on MMLU, although DeepSeek-V2 achieves comparable or superior performance on the majority of testsets compared with its competitors like Mixtral 8x22B, it still lags behind on the Humanity-Moral subset, which is mainly associated with American values.\n\n\n\n1600 years ago, as Emperor of Rome and patron of Constantinople where he is buried, Theodosius II oversaw the central theological questions in the wake of the Council of Nicea and doctrine of Trinity: did Christ have distinct human and divine aspects? Was the human form of Christ the same form as the rest of us? Alongside a university to aid in answering these questions, and the city walls, Theodosius commissioned the construction of a vast cistern to provide fresh water for the city’s inhabitants and palaces1.\n1 Pretentious opening but please indulge me because later on it goes downhill and I end up using the phrases ‘world-view’ and ‘cut-through’.2 Not all of it obviously.3 Please pretend I’m still there for the entirety of the following, otherwise it doesn’t work.It is in a glass-bound spotlit coffee shop above this cistern that I write this post2, complete with visitors centre and free WiFi3. Below me, 32 nine-meter high marble columns support myself and others, our coffees, my bottle of water. We are mercilessly paying homage to Theodosious’ original intentions to provide refreshment here - what once served a purpose continues to do so under a different context. Theodosius’ grave is now lost, most likely beneath the Fatih Mosque where Islamic minorets now anchor the heavens to the city and vice versa. The Christian pasts of the Romans and Byzantines have coalesced with the more recent history of the Ottoman empire, places like this a constant reminder of the slow march of time which seems to have begun earlier and progressed faster here than in any other city.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheodosius Cistern, Taken Februrary 2024\n\n\nIstanbul as it is now, is a city with a complex relationship between Christianity, Islam, and the secular. The Hagia Sofia, a Christian church for 1000 years, an Islamic mosque for 500, and most recently a Museum for 85, is now a Mosque again. As Turkey undergoes broad desecularisation under Erdogan, it seems only appropriate that in a city that has seen so much religious change, I shamelessly engage in mapping the state and future of machine learning onto past and present religious divides (as I have previously done).\n\n\nThis post never quite recovers the highs of the introduction, so please feel free to stop here. Click here to return to homepage.\nWith the large amount of resources required to train state-of-the-art models, teams of researchers have courted the tech establishment in order to gain access to large amounts of computational power. The stakes are supposedly high; a well-trained model in language or image generation may serve as a powerful tool to flood social media with undetectable posts aligned with a given set of values, infiltrate computer networks, or aid in obtaining technological advancements or scientific discovery. It is therefore no surprise that alongside those with business interests at heart, there are nation-states wishing to develop state-of-the-art machine learning models.\nWith so many factors to take into account such as architecture, dataset, and fine-tuning method, the system boundaries when creating machine learning models are necessarily drawn wider than the model itself, encompassing the team, organisation, financial backers, and their values and interests.\n\n\n\nGoogle Gemini’s response, as of Feb 25 2024. Source\n\n\nPeople have recently blamed Google’s corporate culture for a series of questionable large-language model and image generation failures, generating enormous amounts of cut-through. One could argue that it was ultimately the Western Christian values of equality and respect imposed by those that designed the system that resulted in an overly biased model. In this case I would argue that Gemini was projecting a radically Christian world-view, demonstrating respect for those that unquestionably do not deserve it, and nuance in judgements that only the most stoic entity would consider remotely balanced.4 In this case, the model and its outputs are fundamentally tied to those that create it.\n4 The individual failure of the model can be put down to bad fine tuning, but the content emerges pre-fine-tuning and what is intended to emerge post-fine-tuning must be taken into account.As traditionally Islamic nation states with large amounts of resource such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia seek to develop their own machine learning models, it is not a stretch to assume that machine learning models and Islamic values will inevitably cross paths as state actors seek to gain from the benefits of AI. With this in mind, how do Islamic values map onto the existential threat of AI? What would a language model imbued with Islamic values provide?\n\n\nSlight diversion follows\nWestern Christian values allow for a level of flexibility when confronted with the prospect of super-human machine intelligence. The act of bringing ‘something’ into existence is broadly acceptable within this framework (and sometimes encouraged). The questions that preoccupy most people with this worldview are ones of artificial-general-intelligence rights. Can a machine be concious? Is it morally acceptable to turn off a concious machine? How do we treat an AGI?\nHowever, from an Islamic perspective this initial act of creation strikes a more existential tone when the complimentary values of Tahwid5 and Shirk6 are considered. There are two key conflicting arguments concerning the pursuit of human-surpassing intellect.\n5 Tawhid is the indivisible unification concept of monotheism in Islam. Source6 To attribute divinity to anything or anyone else, is shirk – an unpardonable sin according to the Qur’an.7 How should existing religions face the prospect of a model trained on other religious texts?The first perspective is that AGI may help to uncover the secrets of the universe, or provide new ways of interpreting the Qu’ran. Through the use of artificial intelligence, one has become closer to God. This perspective is one that Arabic scholars under the Abbasid Caliphate took when they provided the groundwork for modern mathematics and the number system we use today. In contrast to this viewpoint, an overreliance on super-human machine intelligence (should this be achieved, this seems reasonable) may be interpreted as an idolatrous act of Shirk. Though future rulings may reasonably put this balance down to the data itself that a model is trained on7. There is a delicate balance between science, art and discovery, and religion that continues to be repeated throughout the Abrahamic religions and will be repeated as machine learning gains human-surpassing abilities.\n\n\nDiversion ends.\nAny machine learning model produced by a nation-state with a given ideology may be deliberately or unconciously imbued with these values, just as models produced in the West enforce our set of values. As the uncompromising mirror of generative AI allows us to confront our worldview, we must not be surprised when opposing worldviews instanciate in generative models around the world.\nWhere I am in Istanbul8 is a physical reminder of the neverending race to maintain a set of values within a community, or enforce a set of values on those without them. As a city it has ultimately benefited, layers of history have resulted in a broadly interesting place to visit.9\n8 Stated as fact assuming previous instructions were followed.9 Five word summary for the billboard.10 As opposed to nation-states11 With all the authority of a final-year PhD student in a machine learning-adjacent field.Generative AI now provides a new battleground to enforce a value set in an a way altogether different from any that have come before. It is actually harder to not engage with this as Google has found out. From an organisational perspective, which dominates public-facing machine learning for now10, companies must ensure their values are well defined, clear and consistent11. If not they will emerge regardless, which might not be such a bad thing for the rest of us."

The studio operates collaboratively through what we call rigorous creativity to advance AI applications.\nOur latest project has been working with Peckham Soup Kitchen and the Tate Britain. Over the course of 12 weeks we worked with young people associated with PSK in workshops at the Tate after the gallery was closed to the public. We discussed and explored representations, machine learning, art, and music. One aspect that we quickly settled on was the idea that AI could amplify these personalities and opinions, particularly in a space like the Tate.\nParticipants were told outright by security that ‘there was no workshop tonight’, and we were hounded out of spaces we had every right to be in more than once, only making it more important in our eyes.\n\n\n\nIt became clear that the discussions, critiques, and commentary were thought provoking, funny, and direct in a way that often they are not. After discussions about the provenence of data, we sent the participants around the gallery to simply record themselves and their opinions.\nOur original intention was to use machine learning to learn opinions or pattern match for styles of critique, building up to an interactive ‘avatar’ that would persist throughout the gallery. However the quality of the data was so good, that we felt it would be doing a diservice to these young people.\nIn effect, it was the act of collecting data, discussing the implications, and the possibility of an AI avatar that propelled the participants to talk so candidly.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first used OpenAI’s Whisper model to obtain word-level timestamped transcriptions of over 6 hours of recordings. Using these transcripts, we augmented the conversions by stochastically presenting sentences as spoken by a text-to-speech model. These models speak with authority, and are often American, lending an alternative reading of participants comments."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This post details a consulting/research project for the Winchester School of Art (WSA) digital Rotunda platform, alongside Studio 3015. If you have a similar project or concept, feel free to contact me at tom.savage(at)hotmail.com\n\n\nContext\nThe Rotunda at the Winchester School of Art is a largely digital platform for organizing and presenting research and events. Given the digital nature of the platform, constraints around static design and identity can be relaxed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The WSA Rotunda Research Platform.\n\n\n\nThe goal of this project was to enable existing research lab identities to change dynamically in response to specific media such as text and images related to individual projects. Through the use of generative AI, the visual identity for each lab becomes responsive, adapting based on contextual information around specific initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Existing designs for the E-Textile, Global Smart, Data Image, and Social Practice labs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Manual to Digital\nThe project began by recreating the existing logos for each lab in an automated manner using the svgpathtools library. This enabled programmatic modification of the logo forms via Python, while also obtaining SVG files by design which can be used within WSA graphics. Each logo is subsequently defined by a series of coordinates stored within a dictionary, enabling easy addition of new labs or modification of existing designs.\nFor example, here is the complete specification of the E-textile lab design.\n\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"] = {}\n\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"][\"small_circles\"] = [\n    (0, 0),(0, 2),(0, 4),(2, 2),(2, 6),\n    (4, 0),(4, 4),(6, 0),(6, 2),(6, 6),\n    (4, 6),(0, 6),(6, 6),\n]\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"][\"big_circles\"] = [(2, 0), (2, 4), (6, 4), (4, 2)]\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"][\"connected\"] = [\n    [(0, 0), (0, 2)],[(0, 2), (2, 2)],[(6, 0), (6, 2)],\n    [(2, 6), (4, 6)],[(0, 6), (2, 6)],[(0, 6), (0, 4)],\n    [(4, 4), (4, 6)],[(4, 6), (6, 6)],\n]\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"][\"white_connected\"] = [\n    [(-1, 3), (2, 3)], \n    [(5, -1), (5, 2)]\n    ]\n\nTo construct a given logo I used this information alongside svgpath tools to build up the representation in Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The process of creating a logo computationally from the dictionary that defines it.\n\n\n\nGiven this level of control and automation over the general design space, the next step was determining how the logos should change in response to context. After some experimentation, two key ways were identified:\n\nIndividual ‘shapes’ are allowed to grow and shrink, enabling either a more solid unified form, or a more distributed representation.\nIndividual ‘shapes’ are switched from circles to squares, enabling a more digital and less connected form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Different combinations of parameters and how they affect the base E-textiles lab design.\n\n\n\nIt was decided that these two parameters should provide a representation of how physically distributed a project is, as well how interdisciplinary a project is respectively.\nThese two parameters were chosen to represent how physically distributed a project is, as well as how interdisciplinary it is. By parameterizing the existing designs in this way, each lab’s identity can respond to contextual information around projects, while maintaining the overall form and identity in a controlled manner.\n\n\nColour\nThe colour of each identity with respect to the project is also inferred based on the content. The colour is allowed to change based on the following content characteristics:\n\nTechnical content\nPhilosophical content\nEmotional content\nCultural content\n\nThe ‘amount’ of each descriptor is obtained by prompting a large-language model, and the respective values converted to individual cyan, magenta, yellow, and black values, resulting in a single CMYK colour.\n\nExample:\n\nCONTENT SCORE: {‘technical’: ‘65’, ‘philosophical’: ‘10’, ‘emotional’: ‘15’, ‘cultural’: ‘20’}\nCOLOUR EXPLANATION: The text primarily focuses on describing the technical capabilities and facilities of the WSA E-Textile Innovation Lab, including equipment for textile design, manufacturing, and e-textile development. It also mentions the lab’s mission of creating innovative and sustainable e-textiles, which has a philosophical aspect. The emotional and cultural content is relatively low, as the text is mainly informative about the lab’s operations.\nCMYK: [0.636, 0.114, 0.155, 0.196]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferring Parameters\nTo infer the parameters representing the physical distribution and interdisciplinary nature of a project, an LLM is prompted with both a description and image.\nThe information flow is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The information flow of project description, images, and parameters eventually leading to a given logo.\n\n\n\nSome prompt engineering is performed to ensure that JSON is consistently returned and reliable explanations for the chosen parameters are provided. This includes providing examples of lab descriptions and respective parameters within the prompt as context. When applying image data, the image is first described, and then in a separate call, the description is used to inform the logo.\nEach sentiment and subsequent parameter is prompted separately due to recent advances in low-cost, fast LLM inference to ensure that forgetting or context-shift doesn’t occur.\n\n\nLLM Inference\nLLM inference is performed on Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku. It was found to be extremely low cost, fast, and its performance is sufficient to accurately infer the sentiment of project descriptions and images.\n\nUTC: 2024-03-14T11:50:31Z\nModel Name: claude-3-haiku-20240307\nPrompt: Describe this image.\nImage:\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput: This image shows various electronic and technical equipment. There is a device that appears to be a test instrument or measurement tool, with knobs and displays. Next to it is a device that looks like a portable audio player or recorder. On the table in front of these devices is a document or diagram labeled “Code in Line / Rehabilitation Hand-Night”, which seems to be some kind of technical or engineering schematic. There is also a red tool or instrument that appears to be used for testing or working with the equipment.\nInput Tokens: 795 ($0.25/1000000 tokens)\nOutput Tokens: 108 ($1.25/1000000 tokens)\nTotal Cost: $0.00033375 (0.03¢)\nTime: 3.12 (s)\n\n\n\nCreating an Interface\nThe goal of the interface for the generative lab identity inference was to make it as simple as possible for those with a non-technical background to use, on any device, including Winchester School of Art teaching and administrative staff, and students.\nTo achieve this, the Python implementation was packaged into a Flask app with a basic password-protected front-end. The application is then hosted on Heroku, a cloud-based platform. This exposes the application on the web for anyone to use, protects against the LLM API credits being used by the public, and removes the need to install or interact with code.\nThe user is prompted to provide a project title, description, project visual, and the lab itself. This information is then used as previously described to produce an independent lab logo, with explanation.\n\n\n\nThe user is prompted to provide a project title, description, project visual, and the lab itself. This information is then used as previously described to produce an independent lab logo, with explanation.\n\n\nCreating a Loading Image\nIn order to design a visually interesting graphic for the front end, an image diffusion model was fine-tined. To begin with a new 3D model of The Rotunda was created in AutoCAD.\n\n \n\nUsing this 3D model a number of synthetic images of the building were created and combinined with an existing dataset of real photographs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset of approximately 40 images was then used to fine-tuned a Stable Diffusion model using textual inversion to learn the concept of The Rotunda.\nThis custom token is then used to perform inference (or generation in the context of generative AI) to generate novel representations and views of the building.\n\n\n\nThese representations (in the form of a GIF) provide a sense of the technology involved within the lab logo generation tool, this GIF is also displayed whilst inference is being performed in the background.\nThe images, whilst individually imperfect, collectively result in a coherent representation.\n\n\nOutput\n\nAn example final output for a given project within the E-Textiles lab is as follows:"

    "title": "A personal ranking of Olympic sports",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Olympics are a celebration of human physical achievement. But I simply don’t believe some of the sports should be in it1. In this post, I will present a set of criteria that I believe defines what an Olympic sport should be. I will then use this model to rank the sports in the 2024 Olympics, and see if they pass muster2.\n1 Said with absolutely zero authority2 The conclusions presented should be taken with more than a pinch of salt. I am in no way qualified to make these judgements, and I wouldn’t even say these represent my actual opinions. In effect this post is completely useless, a waste of time, and I’m sorry for making it.\nExecutive Summary\n\nTriathlon and Weightlifting are the pinnacle of Olympic sports.\nFootball and Breakdancing should be removed from the Olympics with immediate effect.\nIf Trampolining was judged completely objectively, it would be comparatively one of the greatest Olympic sports of all time.\n\n\nAfter intense internal discussion with close friends and family3, I have settled on the following three criteria that define a real Olympic sport:\n3 largely at the Imperial students union\nIs winning the Olympics the pinnacle of the sport?\nIs the sport hard?\n\nDoes it look physically difficult, could anyone compete (at any level)?\n\nAre there judges?\n\nIs the sport subjective?\n\n\nTo generate these rankings, I unashamedly used a large-language model to give me a CSV based on these criteria4.\n4 Making the rest of the analysis in this post, in effect, invalid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom five sports are:\n\nGolf\nEquestrian\nSkateboarding\nFootball\nBreaking(/Dance)\n\nAs a quick validation, let’s try to justify the bottom five sports based on the criteria:\n\nGolf: Not the pinnacle of the sport (Masters, US Open, etc.), not hard (large amount of people play).\nEquestrian: Not hard (requires sitting on a horse), relatively subjective (judged on form).\nSkateboarding: Not the pinnacle of the sport (X-Games, generally judged on whether you make a cool video), not hard (anyone can skateboard in a few weeks).\nFootball: Not the pinnacle of the sport (World Cup), not hard (anyone can play football).\nBreaking: Not sure this is even a sport, it’s a dance.\n\nInterestingly, there are a solid 25ish sports that are solidly ‘Olympic’, with a plateau of sports that are all very close in score. Following this things get a bit more volatile5.\n5  These remaining sports would probably be on the Red Button, or BBC Three or something.The guiding assumption in my model here is that my criteria are equally weighted. To investigate the robustness of this assumption, I will use Monte Carlo sampling to investigate different criteria ratios, and evaluate the resulting rankings of Olympic-ness.\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation\nimport numpy as np\nimport joypy\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.cm as cm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# matrix of scores \nscores = np.array([df['Difficulty'],df['Judging Requirement'],df['Olympic Pinnacle']]).T\n\n# save ranks for each weighting\nsampled_ranks = []\nfor i in range(1000):\n    weights = np.random.uniform(1,3,3)\n    all_scores = np.dot(scores,weights)\n    ranks = np.argsort(-all_scores)\n    sampled_ranks.append(ranks)\n\n\n# Create a DataFrame for joypy\nsampled_ranks = np.array(sampled_ranks)\n\njoy_data = pd.DataFrame(sampled_ranks, columns=df['Sport'])\n# column name = Rank\njoy_data = joy_data.rename(columns={'index':'Rank'})\n\n# Create the ridgeline plot\njoypy.joyplot(\n    data=joy_data,\n    overlap=3,\n    colormap=cm.Blues_r,\n    labels=df['Sport'],\n    figsize=(7, 9),\n    xlabels=True,\n    title='Rank'\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a few interesting clusters of sports. I won’t discuss them here, but there is an interesting gap between Athletics and Beach Volleyball, and later between Table Tennis and Archery, but these sports are still all comfortably in the top half of the rankings.\nBreakdancing is squarely at the bottom. I think this is unfair because it simply hasn’t had enough time to develop as a sport. Therefore the criteria ‘is it the pinnacle of the sport’ is biased aganist it.\nTo try and explain some of these distributions, I’ll look into how different specific differences in the criteria weights affect the rankings in a leave-one-out manner.\nEach plot will show the rankings of the sports with one of the criteria removed.

    "text": "Electronic Life was debuted at the Late @ Tate Britain “FREEDOM FREQUENCIES”.\nAI is the new disruptor.\nCome to the Taylor Digital Studio at 8pm to talk directly with Electronic Life - a live AI entity who will respond to your thoughts and queries on new technology and art making.\nAnd meet with young people from Element who have been experimenting with, and challenging, creative AI tools. Through the generation of new texts, images, and music they have generated playful, lyrical, and often surreal motifs to express ideas about their lives. Their work will be presented throughout the evening by ‘Electronic Life’, which has been built from data captured throughout their creative making process.\nElectronic Life was devised in collaboration between Ed D’Souza and Sunil Manghani from Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton with members of Element, Tate Collective Producers, and Tom Savage at Alan Turing Institute.\nElement produces creative projects with care-experiences young people who are often from marginalised and minoritised communities.\n\nELECTRONIC LIFE is a combination of over 2000 images and prompts, text embeddings, a large-language model, an image model, and a speech-to-text model all running locally on a MacBook (M2 Pro) not connected to the internet.\nOver the course of 8 weeks, participants from Element produced 2000 individual images on DALL-E, spanning a total of around 400 individual prompts.\nThese were scraped from the DALL-E online history providing an initial dataset for ELECTRONIC LIFE, formed of the collective ideas of participants.\nWhilst participants formed their ideas independently, they do not exist in isolation within ELECTRONIC LIFE. The pretrained jina-embeddings-v2-base-en embedding model was used to embed the prompt data into vector space.\n\\[\\text{prompt} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Jina Embeddings}} x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{276}\\]\nTo visualise this collective consciousness of ideas from participants, t-SNE was used to map the high dimensional prompt vectors into a lower, two-dimensional space.\n\\[x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{276} \\xrightarrow{\\text{t-SNE}} x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore this space visually, a parametric background function was specified. The function used is similar to a radial basis function, where each prompt ‘weights’ the space in a given location based on the distance to the evaluated location. By providing a set of ever-changing synthetic weights, the background function can be made to warp and shift around the embedded prompts.\nThis is implemented in JAX, enabling two important aspects.\n\nThe ability to calculate and draw the background dyanmically and in real time with vmap.\nAnalytical derivatives through JAX’s automatic differentiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this differentiable background, weighted around the embedded prompts, a momentum-based gradient descent is performed, providing a way of exploring the common themes and ideas. The momemtum term encourages movement throughout the space, and the parametric background ensures that individual ideas are emphasised.\nThroughout the event, audience members are invited to interact with ELECTRONIC LIFE. A number of actions occur when an interaction is triggered.\n\nThe audience member speaks into a microphone and OpenAI’s Whisper model performs a speech-to-text conversion.\nThe resulting text is embedded into the same space as the previously embedded prompts, and cosine similarity is used to return the ‘nearest’ prompt within the dataset, which we will call the memory.\nAn LLM is prompted to relate the audience members comment with the memory within ELECTRONIC LIFE’s internal dataset. A thread is created and inference is performed using Zephyr 7B-\\(\\beta\\) via llama.cpp to generate a response.\nSimultaneously we obtain the image associated with the memory, another thread is created and the image model BakLLaVA is prompted to describe the image within the dataset.\nFinally, the background function is weighted around the memory in the two-dimensional embedding space and all information returned using the pyttsx3 text-to-speech library.\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n​\nElectronic Life: devised by Ed D’Souza and Sunil Manghani from Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton with members of Element and Tom Savage at Alan Turing Institute, with support from Tate Learning Partnerships, Tate Collective Producers and Tate Young Peoples Programmes.

    "section": "",
    "text": "There is no discernible anniversary associated to this review of Gazza Agonistes. The book was first published 29 years ago and describes the events surrounding the life of footballer Paul Gascoigne throughout the 1990s. The author, literary critic and poet Ian Hamilton passed away in 2001. However, his depiction of the rise and fall of a talented man is timeless and universal. Hamilton writes from the perspective of a lifelong fan, willing Gazza up the field from behind the pen, a ‘self-styled Gazzamane’. He celebrates the highs with literary flourish, and reports on the lows with all the authority of a disapproving parent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Hamilton - Collected Poems: Fair use, Link\n\n\nI was first made aware of Gazza Agonistes via a series of recent tweets showing footballers gracing the covers of the London Review of Books throughout the 1980s, with titles such as ‘Social democracy, Sociology, Soccer’. Karl Miller, the editor at the time pioneered as the Guardian put in his obituary, ‘a distinguished style of soccer journalism’. Gazza Agonistes is perfectly placed within this subgenre and seems so far away from the current state of football critique, consisting largely of Mark Goldbridge looking sad.\nWriting in 1994 (with a 1998 afterword written after Gazza’s exclusion from the World Cup squad that year), Hamilton describes being attracted to Gazza’s “legendary scampers” whilst at he played for his childhood club Newcastle, later moving to Tottenham, Hamilton’s childhood club. This transaction of loyalties, from one man’s sporting allegiances to another, provides Hamilton with the emotional license to report on Gazza in a way that is distinct from the tabloid journalists that plague the footballer’s career.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Gascoigne and Vinnie Jones\n\n\nGazza Agonistes highlights just how much the culture of football has changed throughout the last 20 years. Players were expected to take accountability for their own actions; justifications for drunken nights were laundered by the tabloids and aired out to dry in the court of public opinion. The concept of the beautiful game seemed much more tangible when those involved talked and behaved just like those watching in the stands. Gazza would go to the pub with his mates like us, end up in fights like us, and famously shed a tear like us. There is an argument against this level of scrutiny. It destroyed Paul Gascoigne; why should people earning a living have to answer for their actions outside of their work?\nFor better or for worse, player engagements on social media and with journalists are now heavily vetted. Clubs don’t want to risk anything that could undermine their own image, and in turn their net worth. Owners are looking to sell at reputational highs, whilst fans want owners to leave when their clubs are at their lowest. Who knows what Hamilton would think of the players who are expected to answer for nation-states, and how the Gazza of then would respond to allegations of sports-washing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNessun Dorma performed by Andrea Botcelli after Leicester won the 2015/16 Premier League, a song forever associated with the beautiful game following the 1990 world cup.\n\n\nGazza Agonistes is a reminder of a simpler, more passionate footballing time; best enjoyed whilst listening to the soundtrack of the 1990 Italian World Cup Nessun Dorma. For all of Gazza’s mistakes, and the treatment he endured, his epic struggles will not be repeated any time soon, and neither will an account as poetic as Hamilton’s."

Was the human form of Christ the same form as the rest of us? Alongside a university to aid in answering these questions, and the city walls, Theodosius commissioned the construction of a vast cistern to provide fresh water for the city’s inhabitants and palaces1.\n1 Pretentious opening but please indulge me because later on it goes downhill and I end up using the phrases ‘world-view’ and ‘cut-through’.2 Not all of it obviously.3 Please pretend I’m still there for the entirety of the following, otherwise it doesn’t work.It is in a glass-bound spotlit coffee shop above this cistern that I write this post2, complete with visitors centre and free WiFi3. Below me, 32 nine-meter high marble columns support myself and others, our coffees, my bottle of water. We are mercilessly paying homage to Theodosious’ original intentions to provide refreshment here - what once served a purpose continues to do so under a different context. Theodosius’ grave is now lost, most likely beneath the Fatih Mosque where Islamic minorets now anchor the heavens to the city and vice versa. The Christian pasts of the Romans and Byzantines have coalesced with the more recent history of the Ottoman empire, places like this a constant reminder of the slow march of time which seems to have begun earlier and progressed faster here than in any other city.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheodosius Cistern, Taken Februrary 2024\n\n\nIstanbul as it is now, is a city with a complex relationship between Christianity, Islam, and the secular. The Hagia Sofia, a Christian church for 1000 years, an Islamic mosque for 500, and most recently a Museum for 85, is now a Mosque again. As Turkey undergoes broad desecularisation under Erdogan, it seems only appropriate that in a city that has seen so much religious change, I shamelessly engage in mapping the state and future of machine learning onto past and present religious divides (as I have previously done).\n\n\nThis post never quite recovers the highs of the introduction, so please feel free to stop here. Click here to return to homepage.\nWith the large amount of resources required to train state-of-the-art models, teams of researchers have courted the tech establishment in order to gain access to large amounts of computational power. The stakes are supposedly high; a well-trained model in language or image generation may serve as a powerful tool to flood social media with undetectable posts aligned with a given set of values, infiltrate computer networks, or aid in obtaining technological advancements or scientific discovery. It is therefore no surprise that alongside those with business interests at heart, there are nation-states wishing to develop state-of-the-art machine learning models.\nWith so many factors to take into account such as architecture, dataset, and fine-tuning method, the system boundaries when creating machine learning models are necessarily drawn wider than the model itself, encompassing the team, organisation, financial backers, and their values and interests.\n\n\n\nGoogle Gemini’s response, as of Feb 25 2024. Source\n\n\nPeople have recently blamed Google’s corporate culture for a series of questionable large-language model and image generation failures, generating enormous amounts of cut-through. One could argue that it was ultimately the Western Christian values of equality and respect imposed by those that designed the system that resulted in an overly biased model. In this case I would argue that Gemini was projecting a radically Christian world-view, demonstrating respect for those that unquestionably do not deserve it, and nuance in judgements that only the most stoic entity would consider remotely balanced.4 In this case, the model and its outputs are fundamentally tied to those that create it.\n4 The individual failure of the model can be put down to bad fine tuning, but the content emerges pre-fine-tuning and what is intended to emerge post-fine-tuning must be taken into account.As traditionally Islamic nation states with large amounts of resource such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia seek to develop their own machine learning models, it is not a stretch to assume that machine learning models and Islamic values will inevitably cross paths as state actors seek to gain from the benefits of AI. With this in mind, how do Islamic values map onto the existential threat of AI? What would a language model imbued with Islamic values provide?\n\n\nSlight diversion follows\nWestern Christian values allow for a level of flexibility when confronted with the prospect of super-human machine intelligence. The act of bringing ‘something’ into existence is broadly acceptable within this framework (and sometimes encouraged). The questions that preoccupy most people with this worldview are ones of artificial-general-intelligence rights. Can a machine be concious? Is it morally acceptable to turn off a concious machine? How do we treat an AGI?\nHowever, from an Islamic perspective this initial act of creation strikes a more existential tone when the complimentary values of Tahwid5 and Shirk6 are considered. There are two key conflicting arguments concerning the pursuit of human-surpassing intellect.\n5 Tawhid is the indivisible unification concept of monotheism in Islam. Source6 To attribute divinity to anything or anyone else, is shirk – an unpardonable sin according to the Qur’an.7 How should existing religions face the prospect of a model trained on other religious texts?The first perspective is that AGI may help to uncover the secrets of the universe, or provide new ways of interpreting the Qu’ran. Through the use of artificial intelligence, one has become closer to God. This perspective is one that Arabic scholars under the Abbasid Caliphate took when they provided the groundwork for modern mathematics and the number system we use today. In contrast to this viewpoint, an overreliance on super-human machine intelligence (should this be achieved, this seems reasonable) may be interpreted as an idolatrous act of Shirk. Though future rulings may reasonably put this balance down to the data itself that a model is trained on7. There is a delicate balance between science, art and discovery, and religion that continues to be repeated throughout the Abrahamic religions and will be repeated as machine learning gains human-surpassing abilities.\n\n\nDiversion ends.\nAny machine learning model produced by a nation-state with a given ideology may be deliberately or unconciously imbued with these values, just as models produced in the West enforce our set of values. As the uncompromising mirror of generative AI allows us to confront our worldview, we must not be surprised when opposing worldviews instanciate in generative models around the world.\nWhere I am in Istanbul8 is a physical reminder of the neverending race to maintain a set of values within a community, or enforce a set of values on those without them. As a city it has ultimately benefited, layers of history have resulted in a broadly interesting place to visit.9\n8 Stated as fact assuming previous instructions were followed.9 Five word summary for the billboard.10 As opposed to nation-states11 With all the authority of a final-year PhD student in a machine learning-adjacent field.Generative AI now provides a new battleground to enforce a value set in an a way altogether different from any that have come before. It is actually harder to not engage with this as Google has found out. From an organisational perspective, which dominates public-facing machine learning for now10, companies must ensure their values are well defined, clear and consistent11. If not they will emerge regardless, which might not be such a bad thing for the rest of us."

    "text": "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot - Wilco\n\n\n\nThis AIChE was in Orlando. However, due to a delay at US customs during a layover at Chicago O’Hare I was prescribed the unfortunate detour of an evening in downtown Chicago.\nI begrudgingly recreated the cover of one of my favourite albums as well as ate deep dish pizza and the like… However after arriving in Orlando I presented three talks:\n\n\n\n​\nA Data-Driven Framework for the Design of Reactor Simulations: Exploiting Multiple Continuous Fidelities: Data Driven Optimisation\nIn this talk I outlined the problem formulation and methodology for the optimisation of coiled-tube reactor geometry.\nAdditive manufacturing has enabled the creation of reactors with non-traditional geometries, so to take advantage of this we parameterise the wall and path of a coiled tube reactor and formulate a large, expensive derivative free/black box optimisation problem.\nBecause the closed loop procedure of meshing and simulating a given geometry is so expensive we formulate it as a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation problem with two independent continuous fidelities.\n\n\n\n\n\n TL;DR we use the insights generated via optimisation to design two new flow reactors. We experimentally validate these and demonstrate improved plug-flow behaviour at low Reynolds numbers under steady-flow conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the full read take a look at the preprint. (Savage et al. 2023) Thanks to my co-authors: Nausheen, who recently won the IMechE Process Industries Division Most Distinguished Developing Career Achievement Prize, and Jonathan who without which the 3D printing and validation wouldn’t have been possible, as well as Prof Omar Matar and Dr Antonio del Rio Chanona.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe presenting the talk. Spot the 3D printed reactor on the table.\n\n\n\n\nExtra polar Gaussian process content and shoutout to GPJax\n\n​\nAs part of this work I parameterised the walls of a coiled tube reactor using a series of polar Gaussian Processes, allowing me to shift and warp the wall whilst ensuring it remains closed and continuous (AKA no leaks!). As part of this I ended up contributing to the open-source GPJax library which has been my library of choice for Gaussian processes for the last year.\nPolar Gaussian processes work by applying a kernel function that operates using modulo-arithmatic. This ensures that as opposed to a data point at \\(\\theta=0\\) and \\(\\theta=2\\pi\\) having zero correlation, they infact have perfect correlation. In short, the correlation between data ‘wraps around’ to the beginning.\nIf we define a standard covariance function such as the Matern function, and simply plot samples from a respective Gaussian process on a polar axis, the results are clearly not continuous in the polar domain.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np \n\ndef matern(t1,t2):\n  d = 2*(t1-t2)**2; p = 2\n  return (1+(np.sqrt(3)*d)/p) * np.exp(-(np.sqrt(3)*d)/p)\n\ndef plot_samples(k):\n  n = 100\n  theta = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,n)\n  covariance_matrix = np.array([[k(theta[i],theta[j]) for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)])\n  mean_function = np.array([1 for i in range(n)])\n\n  fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\n  ax.set_rticks([]); ax.set_rlim(-4,4)\n  cols = ['tab:blue','tab:green','tab:red','tab:orange']\n  for i in range(4):\n    prior_sample = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean_function,covariance_matrix)\n    ax.plot(theta,prior_sample,c=cols[i])\n\nplot_samples(matern)\n\n\n\n\nSamples from a non-polar Gaussian Process\n\n\n\n\nThe samples are not closed because our kernel function believes that \\(2\\pi\\) and \\(0\\) are very ‘far away’, when in fact they are perfectly correlated. A polar kernel function should reflect this fact:\n\ndef polar(t1,t2):\n  tau = np.pi\n  # angular distance\n  d = abs(((t1-t2+np.pi) % (2*np.pi)) - np.pi)\n  return (1 + tau * d / np.pi) * np.clip(1 - d / np.pi, 0, np.inf) ** tau\n\nplot_samples(polar)\n\n\n\n\nSamples from a polar Gaussian Process\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, samples from this Gaussian process are continuous in the polar domain! We can then condition as we normally would on data.\nIn the case of defining the cross-section, we choose to exactly interpolate between 6 equally spaced points. The resulting posterior mean function then defines the cross-section.\n\n\n\n\n​\nMulti-Fidelity Data-Driven Design and Analysis of Reactor and Tube Simulations: Data Science for Complex Fluids and Complex Flows\nIn this talk I discussed the flows that we induced through the optimisation of plug-flow performance.\nDespite only specifying that we wanted the residence time distribution to be as tight and symmetric as possible, we found out that our optimised designs specifically induced Dean vortices at low Reynolds numbers.\n\n\n  Early formation of Dean vortices induced in our optimal design.\n\n\n\n\nSummary slide for the presentation Multi-Fidelity Data-Driven Design and Analysis of Reactor and Tube Simulations at AIChE 2023.\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Robust Energy Policies for Low-Carbon Technology Adoption: Design, Analysis, and Optimization of Sustainable Energy Systems and Supply Chains I\n\nThis talk was highlighting work completed with Dr Gbemi Olueye at the Imperial College Centre for Environmental Policy.\nThere are a number of really great energy policy optimisation problems that include aspects such as the relationship between technology uptake and cost (via a learning rate). Due to obvious reasons broadly concerned with ‘the future’ it is important to account for uncertainty.\nLarge scale uncertainties concerning ‘the future’ (which I differentiate from smaller ‘stochastic’ uncertainties) are often specified by upper and lower bounds. To deal with these we formulate and solve a robust optimisation problem using a parallelised cutting planes approach. This enables us to:\n\nMaintain the original nonlinear energy policy problem\nSolve the problem (approximately) robustly really fast, enabling us to experiment with uncertainty.\n\nIt’s this experimentation that is enabled by the methodology that enables us to provide trade-off graphs to policy makers as the solution itself. Something that I argue should always be done for this class of problem, given the political mandate we as engineers and scientists do not have.\nFor a full overview, click here for the preprint.

We will fix this first.\n\nAlways set the aspect ratio to be equal if both quantities are comparable in meaning and magnitude using ax.set_aspect('equal')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now add appropriate labels, with a legible fontsize to our axis, using LaTeX where appropriate.\n\nax.set_xlabel('$x_1$',fontsize=20)\nax.set_ylabel('$x_2$',fontsize=20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith so many data points, adding some opacity can help the reader interpret the density.

When scaling up the size of this marker appropriately, make sure to reduce the linewidth to ensure that the symbol isn’t too thick.\n\nax.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],color='k',s=50,linewidth=0.75,marker='+');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Linewidth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Linewidth\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be helpful in this situation to ensure the grid is turned on, but remember to ensure it is behind other elements by using ax.set_axisbelow(True).\n\nax.grid(alpha=0.5)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we have different classes that we want to highlight?

    "title": "Tiny Bayesian Optimisation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This GIF was made with only 100 lines of vanilla Python + Numpy + Matplotlib.\n\n\nThere is a Bayesian optimisation gold-rush, and everyone is selling shovels. Bayesian optimisation is core to the concept of self-driving labs, automated drug-discovery, and many other modern research topics. It’s well motivated, and a very useful tool. Start ups are being founded and pharmaceutical and chemicals companies are curating teams that focus fundamentally on Bayesian optimisation in one way or another. As a result, there is now a growing number of libraries, ranging from black-box APIs and no-code solutions to statistically accurate fine-grained representations; each becoming more bloated as new functionalities or usecases are appended.\nWith all of these options, each with their own special definition of a dataset, or a kernel, or an acquisition_function, or otherwise, it becomes difficult to see the wood for the trees. Someone in my group recently asked me if it was reasonably possible to implement Bayesian optimisation, and I more often than not get asked what library or package I use.\nIt is obviously important that BO tools become widely available, particularly to those that don’t know how to code, or don’t have the time such as chemists or industrial engineers. But the trade-off is that students, and practitioners are potentially using something that they don’t understand, and investors may be hoodwinked into investing in something that seems more complex than it is.\nMy mission in this post is to demonstrate that, whilst Bayesian optimisation entails a lot of moving parts, implementing it from scratch really shouldn’t take too long.\nTo make my point, I am going to code everything required for Bayesian optimisation, including visualisation… in under 100 lines of standard Python and Numpy. This will include a custom metaheuristic-based optimisation algorithm, Gaussian processes from scratch with trainable hyperparameters, an acquisition function, and an experimental design loop.\nFirst, I’ll give myself some groundrules:\n\nRules\n \n\nBayesian Optimisation that is competetive with established packages;\nPython Standard Library + Numpy only;\nSimple as possible;\nCode must be interpretable.\n\n\nTo begin with I’ll implement a Gaussian process from scratch.\n\nGaussian processes\nNow I’ll need a kernel function that defines how related two points are in input space. I’ll go for the Matern 5/2. I’m not choosing it because it’s differentiable1, but rather because I think samples from the prior will look most like functions I’m interested in.\n1 This is an attractive property of Gaussian processes that is ultimately distracting when optimising as a result of their nonconvexity, as I’ll cover later.def k(x1,x2,p): # matern 5/2 kernel\n    sigma,l = p[0],p[1] # hyperparameters\n    d = np.sqrt(np.dot(x1-x2,x1-x2))\n    return sigma**2 * (1 + np.sqrt(5)*d/l + 5*d**2/(3*l**2)) * np.exp(-np.sqrt(5)*d/l)\nSimple enough. Forget the hyperparameters now, I’ll cover those later. Now, I’ll give myself the ability to calculate a covariance matrix. I only need to calculate the kernel function for the upper triangular, then symmetrically set the corresponding lower triangular value to be the same2, saving me some time.\n2 Because all valid covariance matrices are positive semi-definite.def cm(x,p): # covariance matrix\n    n = x.shape[0]; K = np.zeros((n,n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i,n): # symmetric\n            K[i,j] = K[j,i] = k(x[i],x[j],p)\n    return K + 1e-6*np.ones(n)\nI’ve added some jitter to the diagonal just to help out when inverting the matrix in a bit. This is relatively common across all Gaussian process libraries. The final GP utility I’ll require is the negative log-likelihood, which will be used to assess hyperparameter performance.\ndef nll(p, x, y): # negative log likelihood\n    K = cm(x, p) # calculate covariance matrix\n    return -0.5 * (np.log(la.det(K)) + (y - p[2]).T @ la.solve(K, y - p[2]) + len(x) * np.log(2 * np.pi))\nNow everything needed has been defined, I’ll create my Gaussian process class. I will simplify the training procedure by making it train on instanciation. The only other thing that is needed is the ability to call it, returning the mean and variance of the posterior distribution at x.\nclass GP: # Gaussian process class\n    def __init__(self,x,y):\n        self.x = x; self.y = y\n        # optimize hyperparameters (sigma, l, constant mean)\n        self.p = tiny_opt(partial(nll, x=x, y=y), np.array([[0.1,10.0],[0.1,10.0],[np.min(y),np.max(y)]]))\n        self.K_inv = la.inv(cm(x,self.p)) # precompute inverse covariance matrix\n\n    def __call__(self,x): \n        k_row = np.array([[k(x,xi,self.p) for xi in self.x]]) # compute row of covariance matrix\n        dot_prod = np.dot(k_row,self.K_inv) # precompute dot product\n        return self.p[2] + dot_prod.dot(self.y-self.p[2]).item(), \\\n            k(x,x,self.p) - np.dot(dot_prod,k_row.T).item()\nIt is defined by data x and y (both row-wise Numpy arrays). I have a mysterious function called tiny_opt which for now provides us with optimal hyperparameters with respect to the negative log-likelihood. This ‘training’ step, and the precompution of the inverse of the covariance matrix3 defines a ‘trained’ Gaussian process. I’ve never really liked that terminology, borrowed from neural network training4. One of these parameters is a constant that defines my mean function. As a result of this, combined with the kernel lengthscale parameter, there is now no need to deal with data normalisation. I’ve previously covered noisy Bayesian optimisation, but as I won’t be dealing with noisy observations here, my GP is noiseless.\n3 Resulting in the precision matrix.4 Though when creating sparse Gaussian processes, the specification of hyperparameters does look more akin to training neural network parameters.Next up, I’ll outline what is actually happening in my tiny_opt function. This will also eventually be used to optimise my acquisition function as well so it’s worth getting right.\n\n\nMetaheuristic Optimisation\nAs I previously mentioned, I see the ability to easily calculate the gradient of a Gaussian process largely as a distraction. I am relatively confident that most people who have any significant experience optimising Gaussian processes will agree. In addition, BO can potentially be made unusually inefficient when using a gradient-based optimiser due to flat regions within an acqusition function, leading to functions such as logEI being proposed.\nGaussian processes, or resulting functions that apply them5 are generally nonconvex. Whilst local minima can be overcome, it’s clear that even in one dimension, there are often as many local optima as data points.\n5 Such as acquisition/utility functions (spoiler).Gaussian processes are practically free to evaluate in the grand scheme of experimental design, and most practical problems are interval-constrained. Combined with the fact that they can of course be evaluted in parallel, motivates the use of evaluation hungry but effective metaheuristics.\nI myself have found them very effective in optimising acqusition functions, and was pleased to see Google’s internal GP optimisation algorithm taking a similar view when they recently released details.\nMy algorithm is self-documented but I will describe it below. I’ve found it to be simple and effective. I wouldn’t even describe it as a metaheuristic. Actually, I will.\nEvery time you refresh this page my algorithm will be named after a different completely arbitrary animal!\n\nanimals = [\n    \"Lion\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\", \"Zebra\", \"Penguin\",\n    \"Kangaroo\", \"Koala\", \"Panda\", \"Tiger\", \"Dolphin\",\n    \"Octopus\", \"Flamingo\", \"Cheetah\", \"Gorilla\", \"Sloth\",\n    \"Platypus\", \"Rhinoceros\", \"Crocodile\", \"Owl\", \"Chameleon\",\n    \"Toucan\", \"Meerkat\", \"Hedgehog\", \"Jellyfish\", \"Lemur\"\n]\n\ndescriptive_words = [\n    \"Swarming\", \"Running\", \"Leaping\", \"Crawling\", \"Swimming\",\n    \"Flying\", \"Pouncing\", \"Slithering\", \"Galloping\", \"Diving\",\n    \"Soaring\", \"Burrowing\", \"Climbing\", \"Gliding\", \"Hopping\",\n    \"Sprinting\", \"Meandering\", \"Prowling\", \"Stalking\", \"Charging\",\n    \"Darting\", \"Scurrying\", \"Lumbering\", \"Prancing\", \"Scampering\",\n    \"Waddling\", \"Zigzagging\", \"Fluttering\", \"Paddling\", \"Swooping\",\n    \"Lunging\", \"Grazing\", \"Perching\", \"Hovering\", \"Circling\",\n    \"Nesting\", \"Foraging\", \"Hunting\", \"Bounding\", \"Swinging\",\n    \"Lounging\", \"Basking\", \"Roosting\", \"Migrating\", \"Hibernating\",\n    \"Camouflaging\", \"Molting\", \"Preening\", \"Frolicking\", \"Stampeding\"\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the…\n\n\n  Algorithm!\ndef tiny_opt(f,b): # small metaheuristic optimization\n    c = np.mean(b, axis=1); b_og = b.copy()\n    b_f = -np.inf; count = 0; w = 1 # track best solution, count stagnation, and shrink factor\n    while True:\n        for i in range(len(b)): # shrink search space around current centre by w\n            r = (b[i,1] - b[i,0]) * w\n            b[i] = [c[i] - r / 2, c[i] + r / 2]\n        # generate random solutions within search space\n        x = np.clip(ra.rand(1000,len(b))*(b[:,1]-b[:,0])+b[:,0], b_og[:,0], b_og[:,1])\n        with Pool() as pool: # evaluate solutions in parallel\n            y = pool.map(f, x)\n        sol = x[np.argmax(y)] # best solution\n        if f(sol) &gt; b_f: # if improvement, update best solution\n            b_f = f(sol); c = sol; count = 0; w = 0.75 # shrink search space next time\n        else: # if no improvement, don't shrink search space next time (set w = 1)\n            count += 1; w = 1 # increment stagnation counter\n        if (b_og[0,1]-b_og[0,0])/(b[0,0]-b[0,1]) &lt; 0.25 or count == 3:\n            # if search space has shrunk below a threshold or not shrunk for 3 iterations\n            return c # return best solution!\nSimply, I sample solutions within the bounds and evaluate them in parallel. If I sample the best overall solution I store this, and shrink the bounds around this point. I then re-sample and repeat. If I don’t find a better solution I don’t shrink the bounds. If I don’t find a better solution for three iterations I terminate. I also terminate if the bounds shrink below a certain threshold. These two properties ensure that the algorithm terminates eventually6. It is effectively a global trust-region method.\n6 EmpiricallyHere’s a little visualisation that I’ve drawn.\n\nWith the ability to optimise functions, all I need is an acquisition function, which is simple enough… and a loop!\nThis is just the expected improvement of a Gaussian process, implemented by importing NormalDist from the statistics standard library.\ndef ei(gp,x): # expected improvement\n    mu, var = gp(x); N = NormalDist()\n    z = (mu - np.max(gp.y)) / np.sqrt(var)\n    return np.sqrt(var) * (z * N.cdf(z) + N.pdf(z))\nAnd here is my loop…\nbounds = np.array([[-10.0,10.0]]) \nwhile True:\n    gp = GP(x, y) # build GP\n    x_opt = tiny_opt(partial(ei,gp),bounds); y_opt = ei(gp,x_opt) # optimise aq\n    x = np.vstack([x,x_opt]) # update x\n    y = np.vstack([y,np.array([f(x_opt[0])])]) # evaluate and update y\n… that’s it!\nBut to really prove that this works, I’m going to even choose an interesting test function to use, and implement the ability to visualise 1D functions7.\n7 Note that all of the above works for any dimensional function.\nPlotting\nTo plot my package to see it it is working, I’ll need a test function. One of my personal favourite ways of doing this is to sample one from a GP prior:\nx_gp = np.linspace(bounds[0,0],bounds[0,1],100).reshape(-1, 1)\nK = cm(x_gp, [1.0,1.0,0.0])\ny_gp = ra.multivariate_normal(np.zeros(len(x_gp)), K).reshape(-1, 1)\nf_gp = GP(x_gp,y_gp); f = lambda x: f_gp(x)[0] # this now acts as my 'true' function\nAn easy way of doing this is by drawing from a multivariate distribution with given covariance matrix and training a GP using this data. This provides a continuous, callable random function without dealing with things like pseudorandom number generation.\nI’ve written before about plotting practices (here and here), so I won’t go into too much detail. Here is the code that evaluates the GP and acqusition function and plots them both.\nIn addition, I save each plot and produce a GIF at the end.\n    x = np.linspace(bounds[0,0],bounds[0,1],3).reshape(-1, 1)  # initial training data\n    y = np.array([f(xi) for xi in x]).reshape(-1, 1) # initial training data\n    x_test = np.array([xi for xi in np.linspace(bounds[0,0],bounds[0,1],200)]).reshape(-1, 1) # test data\n    images = []\n    for _ in range(16):\n        gp = GP(x, y) # create GP\n        x_opt = tiny_opt(partial(ei,gp),bounds); y_opt = ei(gp,x_opt)\n        mu, var = np.array([gp(xi) for xi in x_test]).T; std = np.sqrt(var)\n\n        fig,ax = plt.subplots(2,1,figsize=(8,3),sharex=True,constrained_layout=True)\n        ax[1].set_xlabel('$x$');

That is what makes BO as a tool so powerful. There are always a host of interesting domain-specific problems to be solved, but by demystifying BO as a whole it becomes easier to make these adjustments or developments.\nI personally think that BO software has become overly cumbersome, but there are many moving parts, and it never quite turns out to be the one-size-fits all solution it is billed as. I don’t think there’s a long term solution or fix to this at the moment, I would only say to try it for yourself!"

    "text": "Here I will outline my personal preferences for best plotting practices for optimisation trajectory plots using Matplotlib. I will be initialising the plot as demonstrated in my previous posts here and here.\nI won’t outline a single solution here, but rather a number of options and best practices.\nI’ll start by plotting the following objective function:\n\\[\\min_{x_1,x_2} \\quad 100(x_2-x_1^2)^2 + (x_1-1)^2 \\]\n…and in Python, using MLX.\n\nimport mlx.core as mx\n\ndef f(x1,x2):\n    return 100*(x2-(x1**2))**2 + (x1-1)**2 +1\n\nFor now we will use the bounds -3 and 3 for both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). We can apply MLX’s vmap functionality to really quickly evaluate an entire grid of points in parallel.\n\nf_grid = mx.vmap(mx.vmap(f,in_axes=(None,0)),in_axes=(0,None))\nn = 100 \nlb = -3; ub = 3\nx1 = mx.array([2.0])\nx1 = mx.linspace(start=lb,stop=ub,num=n)\nx2 = mx.linspace(start=lb,stop=ub,num=n)\n\ny = f_grid(x1,x2).T\n\nJust for peace-of-mind, lets compare the time it takes to evaluate the function on a 100 X 100 grid the standard way:\n\nimport timeit \n\ndef normal_mat(x1,x2):\n    y = np.zeros((n,n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            y[i,j] = f(x1[i],x2[j])\n    return y.T\n\nnumpy_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: normal_mat(np.array(x1),np.array(x2)),number=10)\nmlx_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: f_grid(x1,x2),number=10)\n\nprint('Numpy (s): ',numpy_time,' ','MLX (s): ',mlx_time,'\\n')\nprint(np.round(numpy_time/mlx_time,4),' times faster.',);\n\nNumpy (s):  0.20080224995035678   MLX (s):  0.0006692500319331884 \n\n300.0407  times faster.\n\n\nWe begin by plotting these evaluations the default way…\n\nX1,X2 = np.meshgrid(x1,x2);\nplt.contourf(X1,X2,y,levels=100);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with 2D scatter plots, we will set up the plot using Matplotlib’s object orientated syntax, set the aspect ratio to be equal using ax.set_aspect('equal'), and add labels of an appropriate size.\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,6))#| \nax.set_xlabel('$x_1$',fontsize=16)\nax.set_ylabel('$x_2$',fontsize=16)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, we need a colorbar in order to interpret values of the function. By doing it in the following way we have more control over its position and options.\n\nfrom mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable\n\nfun = ax.contourf(X1,X2,y,levels=100)\ndivider = make_axes_locatable(ax)\ncax = divider.append_axes('right', size='5%', pad=0.1)\nfig.colorbar(fun, cax=cax, orientation='vertical').set_label(label='Objective Function Value',size=16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we will be plotting an optimisation trajectory on top of this, we should use a softer, more subtle colourmap. My personal favourite is Spectral (but I’m going to reverse it by appending _r).\n\nfun = ax.contourf(X1,X2,y,levels=100,cmap='Spectral_r')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function has very steep sides, with a shallow u-shaped valley. It would be better to plot the logarithm of the objective function. We can do this by defining where we want the levels to be using geomspace which creates logarithmically spaced values between the minimum and maximum values of the objective function.\nI also change the ticks of the colourbar to match the levels of the contour plot.\n\nlevs = np.geomspace(np.min(np.array(y)), np.max(np.array(y)), num=10)\nfun = ax.contourf(X1,X2,y,levs,cmap='Spectral_r',locator=ticker.LogLocator())\n\nticks = np.round(levs,2)\ncbar = fig.colorbar(fun, cax=cax, orientation='vertical')\ncbar.set_label(label='Objective Function Value',size=16)\ncbar.set_ticks(ticks)\ncbar.set_ticklabels(ticks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering we will be plotting a trajectory on top of this background it makes sense to make it a little more subtle. We can do this by reducing the alpha value of the colourmap.\nTo maintain some distinction between level-sets, we can plot some faded, thin contour lines in addition to the filled contour.\n\nfun = ax.contourf(X1,X2,y,levs,cmap='Spectral_r',locator=ticker.LogLocator(),alpha=0.4)\nax.contour(X1,X2,y,levs,colors='k',linewidths=0.5,alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK now to solve an optimisation problem, I will write probably the shortest first-order optimisation algorithm possible in MLX.\n\nx = mx.array([2.0,-2.0])\ngrad = mx.grad(f,argnums=(0,1))\nx_store = np.array(x)\nfor i in range(500):\n    x = x - 0.0002*mx.array(grad(x[0],x[1]))\n    x_store = np.vstack((x_store,np.array(x)));\n\nNow I will plot the trajectory on top of the objective function, alongside highlighting the initial solution, and the final solution.\nI’ll leave these black just to avoid any clashes with the background colourmap.\n\nax.plot(x_store[:,0],x_store[:,1],lw=2,c='k')\nax.scatter(x_store[0,0],x_store[0,1],s=100,c='k',marker='.',zorder=10,lw=2)\nax.scatter(x_store[-1,0],x_store[-1,1],s=100,c='k',marker='+',zorder=10,lw=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there’s many more things you could do here, such as highlighting step sizes etc… but I’ll leave it there for now."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nBayesian optimisation has been successfully applied in a number of complex domains including engineering systems where derivatives are often not available, such as those that involve simulation or propriety software. By removing the human from decision-making processes in favour of maximising statistical quantities such as expected improvement, complex functions can be optimised in an efficient number of samples. However, these engineering systems are often engaged with by domain experts such as engineers or chemists, and as such the behaviour of the underlying function cannot be considered completely unknown a-priori. Therefore, there exists significant scope to take advantage of the benefits of Bayesian optimisation in optimising expensive derivative-free problems, whilst enabling domain experts to inform the decision-making process, putting the human back into the loop. By providing an optimal set of alternatives to an expert to select their desired evaluation, we ensure that any one choice presents information gain about the optimal solution. Simultaneously, we ensure the choices are distinct enough to avoid the human making an effective gradient calculation. Alternative solution information such as utility function value, predictive output distribution and visualisations are provided to the expert as a pseudo-likelihood. The decision-maker then effectively performs discrete Bayesian reasoning, internally conditioning the provided information with their own prior expertise and knowledge of the solutions provided. In addition to improved convergence (depending on the ability of the domain expert), our methodology enables improved interpretability in higher dimensions, as the decision-maker has the final say in what is evaluated. Our approach works with any utility function and NSGA-II (Deb et al. 2002) is applied for multi-objective optimisation, efficiently handling the non-convex utility-space.\nFigure 1 demonstrates our methodology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Overview of our methodology, where an augmented batch Bayesian optimisation problem is solved using multi-objective optimisation, providing an expert with a set of alternate solutions.\n\n\n\nBy allowing an expert to influence the experimental design through a discrete decision step, we mitigate the expert needing to make continuous decisions throughout, and do not rely on an expert `prior’ of the global optimum that necessarily must be defined before optimisation. Approaches that rely on an expert-defined prior may need to redefine this at significant human-cost throughout optimisation in light of new information. Similarly, the expert has no influence over the actual solutions evaluated and the optimisation is merely weighted towards broad regions in solution-space."

(Hvarfner et al. 2022) and (Ramachandran et al. 2020) use user-defined priors to weight the acquisition function, while (Liu 2022) diminishes this weight over time. These methods are static and don’t allow real-time expert input. (Gupta et al. 2023) allows continuous expert involvement, using a linear Gaussian process to approximate human intuition, achieving sub-linear regret bounds. (Kumar et al. 2022) and (Maus et al. 2022) present similar frameworks, offering alternative solutions for evaluation, with the expert making the final decision latterly in a molecular design setting."

Let \\(p\\) be the number of alternate solutions provided to the expert and construct the decision variable matrix \\(\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(p-1)\\times n}\\) by concatenating \\(p-1\\) alternate solutions \\(\\mathbf{X} := [\\mathbf{x}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{p-1}]\\). We then define the high-throughput (batch) utility function \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{U}}\\) which is specified as the sum of the individual utilities of alternate solutions within \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    \\hat{\\mathcal{U}}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \\mathcal{U}(\\mathbf{X}_i).\n\\end{align}\\] Similarly, we introduce \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}\\) as a measure for capturing the variability among both the optimal and alternative solutions. Specifically, let \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}\\) be the determinant of the covariance matrix \\(K_{\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{aug}}}\\) for the augmented set \\(\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{aug}}= \\mathbf{X} \\cup \\mathbf{x}^*\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{x}^*) &= |K_{\\mathbf{X_{\\text{aug}}}}| \\\\\nK_{\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{aug}}} &= [k(\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{aug},i},\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{aug},j})]^p_{i,j=1}\n\\end{align*}\\] \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}\\) quantifies the ‘volume of information’ spanned by the alternative solutions \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) as well as the optimal solution \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\).

Contrary to this, maximising \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}\\) will result in a set of solutions that are maximally-spaced both with respect to other alternatives, but also \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\). At iteration \\(t\\), we then solve the following multi-objective optimisation problem: \\[\\begin{align}\\label{multi-objective}\n    [\\mathbf{X}^*_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{X}^*_m] = \\max_{\\mathbf{X}} \\; \\left(\\hat{\\mathcal{U}}(\\mathbf{X};\\mathcal{D}_t),\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{x}^*)\\right),\n\\end{align}\\] resulting in a set of \\(m\\) solutions along the Pareto front of both objectives. From this we define \\(\\mathbf{X}^*_{k}\\) as the solution at knee-point of the Pareto front. The \\(p-1\\) solutions contained within \\(\\mathbf{X}^*_k\\) optimally trade off the sum of their utility values, with their variability. This ensures that when provided to an expert, alongside \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\), any individual solution will have high expected information gain, and the solutions themselves will be distinct enough to ensure the expert isn’t made to make an effective gradient calculation.\nThe practitioner is then made to choose a solution to evaluate from this set of alternatives. To do so, they are provided with information such as the utility value of each solution, expected output distributions (obtained from the Gaussian process), and information regarding previous solutions that they may wish to draw upon. In doing so, the practitioner effectively performs an internal discrete Bayesian reasoning, conditioning previous prior information and expert opinion with the mathematical quantities provided to make an informed decision. Our algorithm can be located within the Appendix.\nFigure 2 demonstrates the intended behaviour of our approach. We present a one-dimensional case study, optimising a function obtained through sampling a Gaussian process prior, specified by a Matern 5/2 kernel with lengthscale \\(l=0.5\\).

    "text": "4 Computational Results & Discussion\nTo assess our approach, we benchmark it against standard Bayesian optimisation. In order to incorporate and assess human interaction in an automated manner, we hypothesise a number of different human behaviours. The ‘Expert’ practitioner represents an ideal, where the best solution (that is the one with the highest true objective value) is always selected. Equivalently, to test the performance of our approach under the influence of a practitioner with misaligned knowledge, we present an ‘Adversarial’ practitioner who consistently selects the solution with the lowest true objective value. In addition, we present a probabilistic practitioner, who selects the solution with the best true objective value with some probability. Finally, we present the behaviour of a ‘Trusting’ practitioner who selects the solution with the largest utility (as these values are presented), equivalent to standard Bayesian optimisation as this solution is obtained through standard single objective optimisation (Equation 1). In practice, the expert will condition the information provided with their prior beliefs. In our approach this includes information regarding the expected distribution of the objective of each solution, as well as the utility value of each solution. Whilst we cannot benchmark real human behaviour due to the random nature of the objective functions, and practical issues, the behaviours described summarise key aspects in order to generate useful insights into our approach, we leave this for future work. The human behaviours applied are summarised within Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Human Behaviours Applied for Benchmarking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehaviour Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nExpert\nSelects the solution with the best true function value.\n\n\nAdversarial\nSelects the solution with the worst true function value.\n\n\nTrusting\nSelects the solution with the maximum utility value.\n\n\np(Best)\nSelects the solution with the best true function value with probability p(Best), otherwise selects a random solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe perform optimisation over 50 functions, each representing a sample from a Gaussian process prior with lengthscale 0.3 using the upper-confidence bound (UCB) utility function. Figure 3 demonstrates the average and standard deviation of simple regret, and average regret (both defined within Garnett (2023)) for each human behaviour across 1D and 2D objective functions.\nResults for 5D, and specific functions can be located within the Appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Average regret quantities over 1D objective functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Average regret quantities over 2D objective functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Regret expectation over 50 functions, \\(f \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(\\mu \\equiv 0, K_M (d,\\nu = 0.3))\\) where \\(K_M\\) is the Mat'ern 5/2 kernel function. 4 alternate choices are presented to the practitioner, and the utility function \\(\\mathcal{U}(x)\\) used is the upper-confidence bound.\n\n\n\nThe expectation of average regret tends towards zero for all behaviours, indicating empirical convergence. Focusing on results from the set of 1D functions, an ‘Expert’ provides improved convergence than standard Bayesian optimisation (‘Trusting’) throughout all iterations, with benefits diminishing throughout the later stages, where the standard automated approach recovers the ‘Expert’ average regret value, confirming previous observations regarding the importance of human input throughout earlier iterations, and conversely diminishing importance of expert opinion during `fine-tuning’ Kanarik et al. (2023). Improved convergence of simple regret occurs in cases where the practitioner selects the ‘best’ solution from a set 75%, 50%, and to a lesser extent 25% of the time out of 4 available choices, similarly reflected in trends across average regret. The results demonstrated in Figure 3 indicate the potential for our approach to improve the convergence of Bayesian optimisation even in cases where the practitioner is correct about a decision only partially. When the expert makes a random selection (\\(p(\\text{Best}) = 0.25\\), for 4 alternate solutions), standard Bayesian optimisation convergence is recovered, indicating the effectiveness of the choices presented by asking a practitioner to select between distinct solutions, each of which individually has a high utility value. This is reflected throughout 1D, 2D and 5D functions. Only in the case where the practitioner actively selects the worst solution (i.e. they are misaligned), is performance worse. In higher-dimensions an adversarial practitioner performs worse, as they are performing inefficient space-filling in an increasingly larger volume before good solutions are found.\nThe methodology we present may also be interpreted as an approach for high-throughput/batch Bayesian optimisation, with an additional preference for solutions that are well-distributed throughout the search space. Our intention for future work is to benchmark it against other existing batch Bayesian optimisation methodologies González et al. (2015), including those with similar multi-objective formulations (Bischl et al. (2014), Habib, Singh, and Ray (2016), Maus et al. (2022)). We will also investigate to what extent large-language models can perform the selection step."

    "text": "The Chinese room thought experiment provides an argument for why computers will never be able to truly ‘think’ (Moural 2003). In effect it states that a machine can be seen to be providing intelligent dialogue or conversation in Chinese, but inside ‘the room’ there is simply someone with a rule book that is large enough to enumerate all the potential answers, and the rules to generate and combine them (in effect, the structure of Chinese). This person doesn’t truly know or think about what they are doing. Whether or not this is a realistic analogy is not something I am going to attempt to answer. To me, the Chinese room, with it’s counter and counter-counter-arguments (Boden 1990), is relatively convincing.1\n\nMoural, Josef. 2003. “The Chinese Room Argument.” In John Searle, edited by BarryEditor Smith, 214–60. Contemporary Philosophy in Focus. Cambridge University Press.\n\nBoden, Margaret A. 1990. The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence. Oxford University Press, Inc.\n1 I also like the implication that if the Chinese room is correct, then either the human brain with it’s electrical and chemical signals is somewhat ‘special’ and has some additional latent features that invoke conciousness/intuition/thought, or conciousness/intuition is actually just a bit of an illusion and there’s nothing to distinguish us from a bloke idly following instructions without understanding what they mean. Both equally fun.But for the purposes of this post, I’m not convinced, I think it’s all wrong.\nHere’s a quote that I enjoy from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy with an interesting extension to the thought experiment.\n\n[…] He [Searle] suggests a variation on the brain simulator scenario: suppose that in the room the man has a huge set of valves and water pipes, in the same arrangement as the neurons in a native Chinese speaker’s brain. The program now tells the man which valves to open in response to input. Searle claims that it is obvious that there would be no understanding of Chinese. (Note however that the basis for this claim is no longer simply that Searle himself wouldn’t understand Chinese – it seems clear that now he is just facilitating the causal operation of the system and so we rely on our Leibnizian intuition that water-works don’t understand (see also Maudlin 1989).) Searle concludes that a simulation of brain activity is not the real thing.\n\nIt’s a good point, water-works can’t think, can they? If a brain can think, and a brain can be modelled like a series of pipes, then why can’t a series of pipes think? If I were to replace a single pipe with an actual real neuron, the signal of which controlled a valve to the next pipe, then would my water-works2 be able to think? If I just start replacing all the pipes in my works with equivalent neurons, at what point does conciousness kick in? (Maudlin 1989)\n2 spoiler alert, or… chemical processes.\nMaudlin, Tim. 1989. “Computation and Consciousness.” The Journal of Philosophy 86 (8): 407–32.\n\nSchwitzgebel, Eric. 2014. “If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious.” Philosophical Studies 172 (7): 1697–1721. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-014-0387-8.\n3 This is almost certainly true when you look at Joe Biden; the US still works even if the man in charge is barely with us.4 Normal people will and have used neural networks to attempt this task, choosing to (originally) directly model the interactions between neurons. I’m going to choose to model the water-works, because, funny.5 I might spin this off into a deeptech unicorn.There’s a nice paper that touches on that last point justifying the idea that large organisations, or countries such as the United States can (or rather are) concious (Schwitzgebel 2014).3 With that in mind, I’ll get to the point. Can we design a chemical process to think?4 The fact I’ll be dealing with simulated chemical processes adds a layer of complication because we’re back to asking whether computers can think. But lets assume I’m going to end up building it.5\n\nThe plan\nHow am I going to go about this task? I could cheat and try to model a neural network using a chemical process. After all, neural networks have been proven to be universal function approximators6. I think this is a bit of a boring and sort of cheating. Additionally, attempting to directly find a chemical process that can reason is more interesting than finding a neural network that can reason, because I could feasibly go and build the chemical process in the real world7. The system it would live in is the same as us (i.e. not within the confines of a computer). However, in the ‘lets try to get a neural network to think’-space inherently it still just exists on a computer and you’re back to square one8. You’d have to make the neural network into some physical representation (like a brain)9.\n6 Apparently to the detriment of machine learning as a field, something about making people focus on the wrong aspects of research.7 I could also build the chemical process that approximates a neural network but as I say, boring.8 Or at least a less interesting metaphysical representation.9 This is somewhat similar to the ARIA project Nature Computes BetterQuite obviously, the first reasonable step to building a chemical process that can think, is to build a chemical process simulator.\n\n\nBuilding a Process Simulator\nExisting process simulators are bloated, use outdated GUIs and are not built with machine learning / data-driven workflows in mind. So I built my own. It’s currently written in Python but it might not be one day10. I’ve called it &lt;process&gt;, which you have to write as a code block.\n10 LLM-based code-translation will solve this for me.11 I can’t stress how much better and more useful this is over SFILES workflows (Vogel et al. 2023) which are outdated and stuck in an era where NLP worked on sentences and LLMs that could parse millions of tokens at a time didn’t exist. How are you seriously meant to learn a representation of something as intricate as a chemical process with an abstraction like (raw)(hex)(r)[&lt;(pp)&lt;(raw)](mix)&lt;.... Unless you train an LLM from scratch on SFILES (spoiler: you can’t because there is no where near enough data) they’re completely useless to use as a representation, because SFILEs are 1. not in LLM datasets (cannot truly use with pretrained LLMs) and 2. pretrained LLMs will struggle to one-shot learn what SFILES is because they’re not easily understandable, parseable or readable. LLMs are a learned representation of language, if you’re going to try and use them for chemical processes, or want a useable process representation then express them using language. SFILES rant over.\nVogel, Gabriel, Edwin Hirtreiter, Lukas Schulze Balhorn, and Artur M. Schweidtmann. 2023. “SFILES 2.0: An Extended Text-Based Flowsheet Representation.” Optimization and Engineering 24 (4): 2911–33. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11081-023-09798-9.\n12 Insert OntoCAPE rant.13 Apart from the silly long previous rant. 14 I only use TOML over YAML because it’s called Tom’s Own Markup Language and that is my name. These are the arbitary decisions I have and will continue to make throughout this post.In &lt;process&gt;, processes are fully represented within a TOML file. The files are detailed enough to provide a complete representation of a process11. The representation is also not too detailed where there would be extraneous effort to define it, reducing bloat12. If you’re far enough into process design that you want to model a process in significant detail then ‘rigorous’ tools such as Aspen or gProms are what you want anyway. &lt;process&gt; is not for rigorous design, it sits somewhere between SFILES, and Aspen in terms of complexity. It’s main advantage over SFILES13is that chemical processes can be simulated directly from an interpretable text-based toml file14. &lt;process&gt; is effectively a compiler for chemical processes, compiling a readable text-based format into an object that can be simulated and analysed.\nHere’s an example process.toml file.\n\n\nShow process.toml file…\n\n[[species]]\nname = \"water\"\nmolecular_weight = 18.01528 # kg/kmol\ncp_poly_coeffs = [276370.0, -2090.1, 8.125, -0.014116, 9.3701e-6]\nenthalpy_of_formation = -285830.0 # kJ/kmol\n\n[[species]]\nname = \"benzene\"\nmolecular_weight = 78.11\ncp_poly_coeffs = [162940.0,-344.94,0.85562]\nenthalpy_of_formation = 48950.0\n\n[[species]]\nname = \"nitric_acid\"\nmolecular_weight = 63.013\ncp_poly_coeffs = [131250.0,-121.9,0.1704]\nenthalpy_of_formation = -169100.0\n\n[[species]]\nname = \"nitro_benzene\"\nmolecular_weight = 123.109\ncp_poly_coeffs = [295300.0,-80.7,1.705]\nenthalpy_of_formation = 12500.0\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"benzene_inlet\"\nmolar_flowrate = 0.5 # kmol\nmolar_ratios = {benzene = 1}\ntemperature = 298 # K \npressure = 101325 # Pa\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"nitric_acid_inlet\"\nmolar_flowrate = 0.5\nmolar_ratios = {nitric_acid = 1}\ntemperature = 312\npressure = 101325 # Pa\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"reactor_products\"\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"reactor_products_cooled\"\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"reactor_reactants\"\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"final_product\"\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"tops\"\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"waste_water\"\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"pure_product\"\n\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"benzene_recycle\"\nmolar_flowrate = 0\nmolar_ratios = {benzene = 1}\ntemperature = 298\npressure = 101325\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"recycle\"\nmolar_flowrate = 0\nmolar_ratios = {water = 1}\ntemperature = 298\npressure = 101325\n\n[[separator]]\nname = \"separator_one\"\ninlet = [\"final_product\"]\noutlet = [\"tops\", \"waste_water\"]\nspec = [{nitro_benzene= 0.95},{water= 0.95}]\n\n[[separator]]\nname = \"separator_two\"\ninlet = [\"tops\"]\noutlet = [\"pure_product\", \"benzene_recycle\"]\nspec = [{nitro_benzene= 0.99},{benzene = 0.95}]\n\n\n[[mixer]]\nname = \"reactant_mixer\"\ninlet = [\"benzene_inlet\", \"nitric_acid_inlet\",\"recycle\",\"benzene_recycle\"]\noutlet = [\"reactor_reactants\"]\n\n[[reactor]]\nname = \"reactor_one\"\ninlet = [\"reactor_reactants\"]\noutlet = [\"reactor_products\"]\nreactant_stoichiometry = {benzene=1, nitric_acid=1}\nproduct_stoichiometry = {water = 1, nitro_benzene =1}\nconversion = {benzene=0.9}\n\n[[splitter]]\nname = \"splitter_one\"\ninlet = [\"reactor_products_cooled\"]\noutlet = [\"final_product\", \"recycle\"]\nsplit_ratio = [0.8, 0.2]\n\n\n[[heat_exchanger]]\nname = \"product_cooler\"\ninlet = [\"reactor_products\"]\noutlet = [\"reactor_products_cooled\"]\noutlet_temperature = 298\n\nBy design, it’s relatively self-explanatory. You define molecular species, all the streams, their connections, etc. Unit operations each have specific attributes which must be defined such as the split ratio of a splitter. You don’t have to specify everything15, &lt;process&gt; will attempt to simulate unit operations with specified inlet streams until the entire process converges. Degrees-of-freedom are currently quite uncompromising. There is no way to fix a stream, and every variable can be changed. There is no need for a specific ‘recycle’ block or stream due to the way a process is converged. At the expense of bloat, you have to pay slightly more attention to what is being defined, which is not the worst trade off.\n15 If you could then this would be a pointless tool.Anyway, I might write this up a bit longer at some point depending if I flesh it out a bit. For now, onwards…\nI can visualise a process as follows:\n\nprocess_file = \"nitrobenzene_process.toml\"\nprocess = parse_process(process_file)\nprocess.plot(\"outputs/process.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visualised process.\n\n\nAnd simulate it as so:\n\nprocess.simulate(tol=1e-7)\nprocess.plot_convergence(\"outputs/convergence.png\")\n\nStream Tolerance -&gt; 2.20e+00 -&gt; 5.29e-01 -&gt; 1.12e-01 -&gt;...-&gt; 9.47e-07 -&gt; 3.83e-07 -&gt; 1.54e-07\nConverged in 30 iterations.\n\n\n\n\n\nConvergence of a process.\n\n\n16 This is done by analysing streams to see if they come from, or go to a unit operation. If not, they are designated process inlet or outlets and quantities summed.The overall mass and energy balance can be validated16, and I can also print off the steady-state of the convergenced process.\n\nprint(process, '\\n')\nprint(process.confirm_energy_balance(), '\\n')\nprint(process.confirm_mass_balance())\n\n\n\nShow convergenced process

reactions with stoichiometric ratios, components with specific heat capacities as a funciton of temperature… this should be enough for now.\n\n\nNow what?\nThe goal here is to build an input-output machine, that on the surface acts like the ‘room’ in the Chinese room, and more precisely, the waterworks within the room as proposed by Searle in his brain simulator scenario. To make this easier, when I say ‘think’, I mean I’m going to approximate a function, because as I previously mention, I don’t believe in the Chinese room argument.\nI will go about doing this through direct simulation , where the chemical process is directly used to model a function via something analygous to symbolic regression or evolutionary programming.17\n17 Alternative methods would be to either: 1. Build up the basic building blocks of computation, i.e. AND, OR, gates etc… Then by extension demonstrate how a computer can be constructed, and therefore a universal function approximator (2 layers of abstraction below thinking). Or… 2. Build up the basic building blocks of a neural network, which, as a universal function approximator, completes the ability to approximate functions (1 layer of abstraction below thinking). But as previously mentioned, I want the chemical process to be as close as possible to the function approximation task at hand. Therefore, the mathematical problem I will solve will be a least-squares (machine learning) task over chemical processes:\n\\[\n\\min_{\\mathcal{P}} \\sum_{i=1}^N ||\\mathcal{P}(x_i) - y_i||^2_2\n\\]\nwhere a chemical process \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is defined by a set of unit operations \\(\\mathcal{O}\\), connecting streams \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), yappa yappa blah blah blah… Basically, you choose what the input \\(x\\) represents in your process, and what the output \\(y\\) represents. Simulate the chemical process for a given \\(x\\) and evaluate the output. Do this for all values of \\(x\\) in the dataset and you can evaluate how well the process approximates the function.\nThat being said, I am going to solve this optimisation problem using evolutionary programming. Firstly, I’ll demonstrate a way of evaluating the objective function.\nWe need some data.\n\nn = 100\nx = np.random.uniform(0,1.5*np.pi,n)\ny = np.sin(x) + np.random.normal(0,0.2,n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin with I will define a very basic process with a single component as an inlet stream, a single component as an outlet stream, and a mixer that doesn’t do anything.\n[[species]]\nname = \"water\"\nmolecular_weight = 18.01528 # kg/kmol\ncp_poly_coeffs = [276370.0, -2090.1, 8.125, -0.014116, 9.3701e-6]\nenthalpy_of_formation = -285830.0 # kJ/kmol\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"inlet\"\nmolar_flowrate = 0.5 # kmol\nmolar_ratios = {water = 1}\ntemperature = 298 # K \npressure = 101325 # Pa\n\n[[streams]]\nname = \"outlet\"\n\n[[mixer]]\nname = \"mixer\"\ninlet = [\"inlet\"]\noutlet = [\"outlet\"]\n\n\n\nFor now, assuming temperature of both the inlet stream and outlet stream represent my functional input and output respectively, I can simulate the process and evaluate the objective function as follows:\n\ny_test = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    process.streams['inlet'].temperature = x[i]\n    process.simulate(tol=1e-7)\n    y_test.append(process.streams['outlet'].temperature)\n\n\nCan you see where we’re going yet?\nI can take advantage of multiprocessing to evaluate the objective function in parallel. This is a strength of &lt;process&gt;, and is a good demonstration of designing something like a process simulator with machine learning use cases in mind.\nI’ll assume that physical units can be scaled later on. Now I can hypothesise that there is a heat exchanger between the streams, with a given temperature decrease to get a different ‘loss’ between our data and the process output.\n[[heat_exchanger]]\nname = \"product_cooler\"\ninlet = [\"inlet\"]\noutlet = [\"outlet\"]\ndelta_temperature = -3 # K\n\n\n\nI’ll stop here, we get the idea. We can change the type of unit operation, their internal parameters, and their order to try and approximate a function. Now we have the ability to:\n\nEvaluate how well our process can approximate a function;\nMutate the process,18\n\n18 Once again, by building a lightweight process simulator we have gained the ability to easily modify the process structure enabling us to solve an optimisation problem over different structures, something that takes PhD lengths of time to do in Aspen or gProms.19 Presented in an unnessiscarily complex amount of detail, remember?We can build a basic evolutionary programming framework to solve the optimisation problem above19.\nThis is what I will do.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences"

To further emphasise the collaborative role, we prompted each student for how human, natural, and mechanistic they believe their project to be. Then, we asked the AI to provide4 the same set of values between 0-100.\n4 Through similar few-shot prompting as demonstrated aboveThese three parameters in turn control the size and location of text as it overlays onto both the augmented visual and the original visual (now combined).\nHere, closer text in terms of location and size represents a level of similarity between how AI has determined a project to represented, and what it’s creator has intended.\n\n\n\nAt every stage, AI has been used as a tool to enhance the representation of the existing project. To not only determine an appropriate system, but to augment a project image, and raise questions about the intended interpretation.\nAn overview of the information flow is as follows:"

    "text": "Here I will outline my personal preferences for best plotting practices for optimisation trajectory plots using Matplotlib. I will be initialising the plot as demonstrated in my previous posts here and here.\nI won’t outline a single solution here, but rather a number of options and best practices.\nI’ll start by plotting the following objective function:\n\\[\\min_{x_1,x_2} \\quad 100(x_2-x_1^2)^2 + (x_1-1)^2 \\]\n…and in Python, using MLX.\n\nimport mlx.core as mx\n\ndef f(x1,x2):\n    return 100*(x2-(x1**2))**2 + (x1-1)**2 +1\n\nFor now we will use the bounds -3 and 3 for both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). We can apply MLX’s vmap functionality to really quickly evaluate an entire grid of points in parallel.\n\nf_grid = mx.vmap(mx.vmap(f,in_axes=(None,0)),in_axes=(0,None))\nn = 100 \nlb = -3; ub = 3\nx1 = mx.array([2.0])\nx1 = mx.linspace(start=lb,stop=ub,num=n)\nx2 = mx.linspace(start=lb,stop=ub,num=n)\n\ny = f_grid(x1,x2).T\n\nJust for peace-of-mind, lets compare the time it takes to evaluate the function on a 100 X 100 grid the standard way:\n\nimport timeit \n\ndef normal_mat(x1,x2):\n    y = np.zeros((n,n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            y[i,j] = f(x1[i],x2[j])\n    return y.T\n\nnumpy_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: normal_mat(np.array(x1),np.array(x2)),number=10)\nmlx_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: f_grid(x1,x2),number=10)\n\nprint('Numpy (s): ',numpy_time,' ','MLX (s): ',mlx_time,'\\n')\nprint(np.round(numpy_time/mlx_time,4),' times faster.',);\n\nNumpy (s):  0.20080224995035678   MLX (s):  0.0006692500319331884 \n\n300.0407  times faster.\n\n\nWe begin by plotting these evaluations the default way…\n\nX1,X2 = np.meshgrid(x1,x2);\nplt.contourf(X1,X2,y,levels=100);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with 2D scatter plots, we will set up the plot using Matplotlib’s object orientated syntax, set the aspect ratio to be equal using ax.set_aspect('equal'), and add labels of an appropriate size.\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,6))#| \nax.set_xlabel('$x_1$',fontsize=16)\nax.set_ylabel('$x_2$',fontsize=16)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, we need a colorbar in order to interpret values of the function. By doing it in the following way we have more control over its position and options.\n\nfrom mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable\n\nfun = ax.contourf(X1,X2,y,levels=100)\ndivider = make_axes_locatable(ax)\ncax = divider.append_axes('right', size='5%', pad=0.1)\nfig.colorbar(fun, cax=cax, orientation='vertical').set_label(label='Objective Function Value',size=16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we will be plotting an optimisation trajectory on top of this, we should use a softer, more subtle colourmap. My personal favourite is Spectral (but I’m going to reverse it by appending _r).\n\nfun = ax.contourf(X1,X2,y,levels=100,cmap='Spectral_r')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function has very steep sides, with a shallow u-shaped valley. It would be better to plot the logarithm of the objective function. We can do this by defining where we want the levels to be using geomspace which creates logarithmically spaced values between the minimum and maximum values of the objective function.\nI also change the ticks of the colourbar to match the levels of the contour plot.\n\nlevs = np.geomspace(np.min(np.array(y)), np.max(np.array(y)), num=10)\nfun = ax.contourf(X1,X2,y,levs,cmap='Spectral_r',locator=ticker.LogLocator())\n\nticks = np.round(levs,2)\ncbar = fig.colorbar(fun, cax=cax, orientation='vertical')\ncbar.set_label(label='Objective Function Value',size=16)\ncbar.set_ticks(ticks)\ncbar.set_ticklabels(ticks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering we will be plotting a trajectory on top of this background it makes sense to make it a little more subtle. We can do this by reducing the alpha value of the colourmap.\nTo maintain some distinction between level-sets, we can plot some faded, thin contour lines in addition to the filled contour.\n\nfun = ax.contourf(X1,X2,y,levs,cmap='Spectral_r',locator=ticker.LogLocator(),alpha=0.4)\nax.contour(X1,X2,y,levs,colors='k',linewidths=0.5,alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK now to solve an optimisation problem, I will write probably the shortest first-order optimisation algorithm possible in MLX.\n\nx = mx.array([2.0,-2.0])\ngrad = mx.grad(f,argnums=(0,1))\nx_store = np.array(x)\nfor i in range(500):\n    x = x - 0.0002*mx.array(grad(x[0],x[1]))\n    x_store = np.vstack((x_store,np.array(x)));\n\nNow I will plot the trajectory on top of the objective function, alongside highlighting the initial solution, and the final solution.\nI’ll leave these black just to avoid any clashes with the background colourmap.\n\nax.plot(x_store[:,0],x_store[:,1],lw=2,c='k')\nax.scatter(x_store[0,0],x_store[0,1],s=100,c='k',marker='.',zorder=10,lw=2)\nax.scatter(x_store[-1,0],x_store[-1,1],s=100,c='k',marker='+',zorder=10,lw=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there’s many more things you could do here, such as highlighting step sizes etc… but I’ll leave it there for now."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A sneak preview of what to expect.\n\n\n\nI don’t think this is really reccomended. Python is a lot more established for scientific programming. As a researcher you want to quickly prototype a method, or approach to solving a problem. Rust does not let you do this. The only reason I’ve done the following is because:\n\nI have implemented similar algorithms in almost every language I have ever learned.\nIt is a means to an end, to learn Rust’s type and memory management system.\n\nAnd with that, we begin…\n\nI’ll first start with the very basics, defining the function to be optimized, one of the best functions of all time…the Rosenbrock function.\nIn Python this would be written as follows:\ndef f(x):\n    return sum(100 * (x[i+1] - x[i]**2)\\\n        **2 + (1 - x[i])**2 for i in range(len(x) - 1))\nIn Rust we need to define types for what goes in and out of the function to make sure the compiler can perform type checking and ensure memory safety at compile time.\nWe set the output value to be a mutable float, which we add to. In Rust we omit the semicolon on the last line, allowing sum to be implicitly returned as the function’s output.\nfn f(x: Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; f64 {\n    let mut sum = 0.0;\n    for i in 0..x.len() - 1 {\n        sum += 100.0 * (x[i + 1] - x[i].powi(2)).powi(2) + (1.0 - x[i]).powi(2);\n    }\n    sum\n}\nNow I’ll define an initial solution and evaluate this, printing the output of the function. This is simple enough we just need to ensure that our initial solution has the right type.\nWe’ll make x mutable because we only care about its current state during optimization, not its history. This allows us to modify it in-place, potentially saving memory and computational overhead.\nfn main() {\n    let mut x: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0];\n    let f_x = f(x); // evaluate function\n    println!(\"f(x) = {}\",f_x);\n}\n$ cargo run\n$ f(x) = 14814\nvec! is a macro that creates a new vector with specified values without having to push each element individually.\nA key aspect that we’ll need is a basic gradient calculation. For now I’ll implement the forward-difference method. Though this could be the central difference, backward-difference, etc…\nfn forward_difference(f:fn(Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; f64,x: Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; Vec&lt;f64&gt;{\n    let h = 1e-8; // pertubation\n\n    // initialise mutable gradient vector with zeros\n    let mut grad = vec![0.0; x.len()];\n\n    // evaluate function \n    let f_x = f(x.clone());\n\n    for i in 0..x.len() {\n        // define a new solution vector\n        let mut x_forward = x.clone();\n        // perturb \n        x_forward[i] += h;\n        // calculate gradient in this direction\n        grad[i] = (f(x_forward)-f_x)/h;\n    }\n    grad // return grad \n}\nThis takes a vector of floats and returns another vector of floats (the jacobian). We use x.clone() for the initial function evaluation because Rust’s ownership rules would otherwise move x into the function f, making it unavailable for subsequent use in the loop.\nNow I am going to implement a backtracking linesearch to calculate the optimal step-size at each gradient step. We need to define a few constants.\nfn line_search(f:fn(Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; f64, x: Vec&lt;f64&gt;, grad: Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; f64 {\n\n    // linesearch constants\n    const TAU: f64 = 0.5;\n    const C: f64 = 0.5;\n\n    // initialize maximum stepsize\n    let mut a_j: f64 = 0.001;\n    \n    // calculate gradient dot product\n    let m: f64 = grad.iter().map(|&grad_i| grad_i*grad_i).sum();\n\n    let t = - C * m;\n    let f_x = f(x.clone());\n\n    // until condition...\n    loop {\n\n        // create an incremented x along gradient\n        let x_inc: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = x.iter().zip(grad.iter())\n            .map(|(&x_i, &grad_i)| x_i - a_j * grad_i)\n            .collect();\n        \n        // if a sufficient descent...\n        if f(x_inc) &lt;= f_x - a_j * t {\n            return a_j;\n        }\n    \n        // else make the stepsize smaller\n        a_j *= TAU;\n        if a_j &lt; 1e-10 {  // Prevent infinite loop\n            return a_j;\n        }\n    }\n}\nThere’s a fair bit going on here. Firstly, constants are defined using capital letters alongside their type annotation.\nThe dot product is calculated by iterating over elements within grad. We first map over all elements and multiply them by themselves. Then we sum the resulting vector.\ngrad.iter().map(|&grad_i| grad_i*grad_i).sum()\nTo iterate over multiple vectors at the same time we can zip them together as follows:\nx.iter().zip(grad.iter())...\nFinally, when we increment x along the gradient direction, we use .collect(), this converts the iterator which is returned from .map back into a Vec&lt;f64&gt;.\nNow all that’s left is to put it all together, we’ll include a little timing function\n\nfn main() {\n\n    // start timer \n    let now = Instant::now();\n    \n    // tolerance on gradient magnitude \n    const TOL: f64 = 1e-6;\n\n    // initial solution \n    let mut x: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0];\n    let mut grad: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = forward_difference(f,x.clone());\n\n    // gradient magnitude\n    let mut abs_sum: f64 = grad.iter().map(|&grad_i| grad_i.abs()).sum();\n\n    // while this is above the tolerance\n    while abs_sum &gt;= TOL {\n\n        // perform line search  \n        let a = line_search(f,x.clone(), grad.clone());\n\n        // calculate new solution\n        x.iter_mut().zip(grad.iter()).for_each(|(x_i, &grad_i)| *x_i -= a * grad_i);\n\n        // calculate new gradient\n        grad = forward_difference(f,x.clone());\n\n        // calculate new gradient magnitude \n        abs_sum = grad.iter().map(|&x| x.abs()).sum();\n    }\n    println!(\"{:?}\",x); // final solution\n    let elapsed = now.elapsed(); // elapsed time\n    println!(\"Elapsed: {:.2?}\", elapsed); \n}\nThis doesn’t really use anything dissimilar to what I’ve previously mentioned, but it means we can evaluate how long it takes to run. Running in release mode removes some debugging overheads.\n$ cargo run --release\n\n[0.9999993984338057, 0.9999988039652051, 0.9999976181857124, 0.9999952424415648, 0.9999904773199286]\nElapsed: 13.61ms\nWe get the correct answer in 13.6ms.

This is sort of a given, as Rust is a compiled langauge, but it’s good to see.\n\nFlamegraph\nTo benchmark code in Rust we can use Flamegraph to analyse where our gradient descent algorithm is spending most of its time. Flamegraph provides a visualization of the call stack over time, showing which functions are consuming the most CPU cycles.\n$ cargo flamegraph\n\nThese are interactive SVGs which is nice. In this case, given the simplicity and short runtime of our gradient descent implementation, the Flamegraph might not be particularly informative. Most of the time is likely spent in the core computational functions (f, forward_difference, and line_search), without much depth to the call stack.\n\n\nPerformance Improvements\nTo locate a few more performance improvements we need to increase the size of our problem. Let’s start with 500 dimensions.\nlet mut x = vec![0.0;500];\n$ cargo flamegraph\n\nElapsed: 25.68s\nWhich gives us the corresponding flamegraph.\n\nWe can see that we spend most of the time calculating the gradient (i.e. in forward_difference), and then by extension in function evaluations f.\nWe can parallelise the calculation of each directional derivative using Rayon.\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\nfn forward_difference(f: fn(&[f64]) -&gt; f64, x: &[f64]) -&gt; Vec&lt;f64&gt; {\n    const H: f64 = 1e-8;\n    let f_x = f(x);\n    \n    (0..x.len()).into_par_iter().map(|i| {\n        let mut x_forward = x.to_vec();\n        x_forward[i] += H;\n        (f(&x_forward) - f_x) / H\n    }).collect()\n}\nThe main aspect here is using into_par_iter to turn the iterable 0..x.len() into a parrallelised version. Whilst we’re there we turned our h into a constant.\nLargely, everything else is the same. I’ve also used slices instead of vectors to save a bit of memory/writing operations. Just these basic changes result in the following:\n$ cargo flamegraph\n\nElapsed: 8.81s\nA three time improvement on the non-parallelised version. The resulting flamegraph is as follows:\n\nRayon is clearly doing a lot of work here behind the scenes! In practice this work will result in longer solution times for smaller problems, so there are tradeoffs at play. I won’t demonstrate these trade offs explicitly in this post but I have chosen 500 dimensions for a reason.\nJust for peace of mind (again) we’ll run the same problem in vanilla Python. For fairness I’ll parallelise the forward difference function because this isn’t too difficult to do.\nAnd whilst it’s running, I’ll make some lunch."

    "title": "On Ratatouille",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Remy the rat is a culinary genius because he watches a cooking show on TV, read a best selling recipe book, and sometimes eats two things at the same time. He consistently takes life advice by talking1 to a hallucinated dead chef, and generally ignores the majority of social constructs across both rat and human domains. No one did it quite like him.\n1 He speaks english, which humans hear in a higher pitch. As the only difference in Ratatouille between humans and rats is size and frequency (hz) of communication, I will consider them one-and-the-same for the remainder of this article.Ratatouille is a film about legacy, the importance of institutions, and the need for occasional reinvention. Given that rats live for approximately 2-3 years, it is therefore unfortunate that Remy will not have lived long enough to reap the financial rewards from his eloquently named bistro, La Ratatouille, most likely dying mere months after opening.\n\n\n\nThough Linguine basically gives up cooking all together to glide around on roller skates, we can only hope that La Ratatouille has a strong enough institutional memory such that he is not made immediately jobless in the event of Little Chef’s death. Perhaps a smaller, food-loving creature, like a bug, could sit on top of the head of one of Remy’s offspring and be guided by hallucinations of ghost Remy. In turn, the Parisian food scene would become progressively smaller and smaller, and culinary trends would occur at increasingly shorter intervals as the life span of each puppet-master becomes shorter and shorter. Mayfly-atouille would probably fit within a Tiktok.\n\n\n\nOf course, that would be ridiculous. Remy is one of a kind not only among other rats but among humans themselves. It is clear that by the end of the film, all of the other rats in the colony carry some semblence of the spirit of Chef Gusteau with them. They do not steal, they maintain cleanliness, and though Remy has preached the culinary gospel to the masses and has entered the kingdom of Gust…\n Wait? …. Is Remy the rat Jesus? \nThroughout the film, Remy seems to be the only one to be able to engage with the ghost of Chef Gusteau, though he is reminded in a scene where they are both surprised at the same time, that the God-Chef is a figment of his own imagination. This insight tells us that Gusteau is most likely similar to a Christian god, existing in unison within the hearts and souls of rats, and not external to them.\nThe message that anyone can cook is further emphasised by Gusteau in his use of this internal voice, and while Remy at this stage asserts himself as a messenger of Gusteau, he has not yet preached the gospel. By spreading the culinary good-news to the colony, presumably each rat holds with them the spirit of Gusteau while clearly maintaining Remy in high-regard. With that, the holy trinity of Gusteau, Remy, and cooking spirit is finalised.\n\n\n\nWe also observe that there were false prophets in this story, most notably Chef Skinner. Skinner claims to stand for Gusteau but it is revealed that he cares not for good food, and exploits his position for financial gain at the expense of the reputation of Gusteau. For a short time, Collette herself strays from the flock, unsure of the message that Remy preaches, but even she recognises the true message of Gusteau in opposition to the false prophet Skinner.\nWhile Pixar have been nuanced in their portrayal of rat-Jesus, there are two aspects I would like to speculate on where I believe the film did not go far enough, or that may become candidates for a strong sequel.\nThe first addresses the issue of Remy’s short life span. For Remy’s message to truly transcend the short lifespan of a rat and for him to gain immortal status as the one true culinary prophet, Remy had to die. Ideally, he would have remained in the rat-trap from which he inextricably escapes after his dad and brother push a gargoyle off of a church and onto the car boot, crushing the boot just enough to release him. This would have been a commoners death for Remy, unrelenting and sacrificial. In doing so, the rest of the colony would have been empowered to follow in his example, potentially leading to the financial success of La Ratatouille beyond opening night and the proceeding few months.\nBy instead witnessing the initial success of La Ratatouille, Remy more strongly implies that he himself is the anyone that Gusteau refers to. The remaining rats would most likely be less emboldended to consider running a restaurant for humans. In not sacrificing himself in the name of Gusteau’s message, Remy bears more resembelence to Jacob Frank, who claimed to be the reincarnation of the self-proclaimed messiah Sabbatai Zevi, and lived long enough to ensure that everyone around him got bored of the shtick, and his movement fizzled out2.\n2 This is genuinely the message I got from Olga Tokarczuk’s brilliant The Books of Jacob, which I read not in preparation for this article3 Of course, this sequel may take place in a Nietzschean future where Gusteau, as God, is himself dead. Potentially leading to postmodern rat cuisine, a return to eating ‘trash’ (rubbish), or potentially worse.4 Catatouille5 DogatouilleThe second avenue, given we know there is at least one messenger of Gusteau, is that there may be more. These may be copycats/rats that appear based on the presumed commercial success of La Ratatouille, or they may be genuine prophets of Gusteau. There is no reason that dead Gusteau should suddenly stop appearing in the imaginations of animals3, and similarly just because he is the main character we cannot disregard other animals that may have watched Chef Gusteau on TV, for example cats4and dogs5.\nDisregarding the thousands of potential heirs to the La Ratatouille empire specifically, these competing factions of culinarily inspired animals would inevitably vie for legitimacy in an increasingly crowded market. I imagine Remy’s dunce brother Emile would be the first to claim the bloodline potentially leading to a series of culinary-rat-pontiffs that become increasingly disliked. Lollard rats from the countryside may scoff when they hear news of a new Parisian loft bistro being opened, shrines to locations such as the farmhouse Remy originally lived in will be built, and academics will conviene to discuss the implications of the trinity and the true nature of Gusteau.\nIt is clear that the prophesy of Remy, and resulting idylic moment in time, will be short lived. La Ratatouille is built on much more worrisome foundations than it may seem. In preaching the good-news of Gusteau but maintaining his own personal vice-like grip on animal-bistros without a clear succession plan for either the ideology or business itself, Remy will soon learn that anyone can cook.\n\nI have chosen not to touch upon the fact that Remy can control Linguine by pulling on his hair because that is completely unbelievable."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Skoob is a second-hand bookshop that has been operating since 1979 at locations throughout London, before moving to the Grade II listed Brunswick Centre in Bloomsbury in 2007. Skoob has generous opening hours of 10:30am – 7:30pm (apart from on Sundays) and is open 7 days a week.\nOutside, the shop maintains an unremarkable glass and concrete look. It is engulfed by a modernist concrete development and flanked by a big Waitrose. However, walking downstairs from the discrete entrance you are greeted by a rich burgundy floor surrounding a bespoke Skoob logo mosaic. Looking up, there are books everywhere. Where there is a flat wall, there is a bookshelf. Often, books are stacked horizontally in what normally would serve as breathing room between rows, with those on lower shelves spilling out onto the floor. The utilitarian shelves seem to bear the weight of the Brunswick Centre above. The aisles of Waitrose seem a world away.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkoob, taken December 2023\n\n\nThe shop is laid out like a large old key. Turning left, the central spine branches off into a series of small nooks, some with a single chair, some without. The only sound is a light hum emitted from the foil insulated air conditioning pipe that runs along the low ceiling and through the top shelves, forcing books horizontally to make way for the fixture. Operationally, this ensures that Skoob is a completely unnoticeable temperature and volume. Alongside the complete lack of natural light, time stands still. Turning right, the circular bow of the key contains the small staff area and till with shelves that loop around encircling the custodians. Categories of books in Skoob are broad and largely academic. A successful trip would be to come with a given a period, place, or politic in mind\nSkoob forces you to bend and stretch to find worthwhile books (a lot of which are not). The small spaces and full-length shelves, no two of which are the same, make it a physical challenge akin to a marathon as opposed to a sprint, making the task all the more rewarding. Upon purchase, and after travelling back upstairs you are thrust back into a more organised, less interesting world. Whilst Skoob could reasonably be described as chaotic and quite hard work, it is the perfect environment to discover something completely new."

    "text": "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot - Wilco\n\n\n\nThis AIChE was in Orlando. However, due to a delay at US customs during a layover at Chicago O’Hare I was prescribed the unfortunate detour of an evening in downtown Chicago.\nI begrudgingly recreated the cover of one of my favourite albums as well as ate deep dish pizza and the like… However after arriving in Orlando I presented three talks:\n\n\n\n​\nA Data-Driven Framework for the Design of Reactor Simulations: Exploiting Multiple Continuous Fidelities: Data Driven Optimisation\nIn this talk I outlined the problem formulation and methodology for the optimisation of coiled-tube reactor geometry.\nAdditive manufacturing has enabled the creation of reactors with non-traditional geometries, so to take advantage of this we parameterise the wall and path of a coiled tube reactor and formulate a large, expensive derivative free/black box optimisation problem.\nBecause the closed loop procedure of meshing and simulating a given geometry is so expensive we formulate it as a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation problem with two independent continuous fidelities.\n\n\n\n\n\n TL;DR we use the insights generated via optimisation to design two new flow reactors. We experimentally validate these and demonstrate improved plug-flow behaviour at low Reynolds numbers under steady-flow conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the full read take a look at the preprint. (Savage et al. 2023) Thanks to my co-authors: Nausheen, who recently won the IMechE Process Industries Division Most Distinguished Developing Career Achievement Prize, and Jonathan who without which the 3D printing and validation wouldn’t have been possible, as well as Prof Omar Matar and Dr Antonio del Rio Chanona.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe presenting the talk. Spot the 3D printed reactor on the table.\n\n\n\n\nExtra polar Gaussian process content and shoutout to GPJax\n\n​\nAs part of this work I parameterised the walls of a coiled tube reactor using a series of polar Gaussian Processes, allowing me to shift and warp the wall whilst ensuring it remains closed and continuous (AKA no leaks!). As part of this I ended up contributing to the open-source GPJax library which has been my library of choice for Gaussian processes for the last year.\nPolar Gaussian processes work by applying a kernel function that operates using modulo-arithmatic. This ensures that as opposed to a data point at \\(\\theta=0\\) and \\(\\theta=2\\pi\\) having zero correlation, they infact have perfect correlation. In short, the correlation between data ‘wraps around’ to the beginning.\nIf we define a standard covariance function such as the Matern function, and simply plot samples from a respective Gaussian process on a polar axis, the results are clearly not continuous in the polar domain.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np \n\ndef matern(t1,t2):\n  d = 2*(t1-t2)**2; p = 2\n  return (1+(np.sqrt(3)*d)/p) * np.exp(-(np.sqrt(3)*d)/p)\n\ndef plot_samples(k):\n  n = 100\n  theta = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,n)\n  covariance_matrix = np.array([[k(theta[i],theta[j]) for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)])\n  mean_function = np.array([1 for i in range(n)])\n\n  fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})\n  ax.set_rticks([]); ax.set_rlim(-4,4)\n  cols = ['tab:blue','tab:green','tab:red','tab:orange']\n  for i in range(4):\n    prior_sample = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean_function,covariance_matrix)\n    ax.plot(theta,prior_sample,c=cols[i])\n\nplot_samples(matern)\n\n\n\n\nSamples from a non-polar Gaussian Process\n\n\n\n\nThe samples are not closed because our kernel function believes that \\(2\\pi\\) and \\(0\\) are very ‘far away’, when in fact they are perfectly correlated. A polar kernel function should reflect this fact:\n\ndef polar(t1,t2):\n  tau = np.pi\n  # angular distance\n  d = abs(((t1-t2+np.pi) % (2*np.pi)) - np.pi)\n  return (1 + tau * d / np.pi) * np.clip(1 - d / np.pi, 0, np.inf) ** tau\n\nplot_samples(polar)\n\n\n\n\nSamples from a polar Gaussian Process\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, samples from this Gaussian process are continuous in the polar domain! We can then condition as we normally would on data.\nIn the case of defining the cross-section, we choose to exactly interpolate between 6 equally spaced points. The resulting posterior mean function then defines the cross-section.\n\n\n\n\n​\nMulti-Fidelity Data-Driven Design and Analysis of Reactor and Tube Simulations: Data Science for Complex Fluids and Complex Flows\nIn this talk I discussed the flows that we induced through the optimisation of plug-flow performance.\nDespite only specifying that we wanted the residence time distribution to be as tight and symmetric as possible, we found out that our optimised designs specifically induced Dean vortices at low Reynolds numbers.\n\n\n  Early formation of Dean vortices induced in our optimal design.\n\n\n\n\nSummary slide for the presentation Multi-Fidelity Data-Driven Design and Analysis of Reactor and Tube Simulations at AIChE 2023.\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Robust Energy Policies for Low-Carbon Technology Adoption: Design, Analysis, and Optimization of Sustainable Energy Systems and Supply Chains I\n\nThis talk was highlighting work completed with Dr Gbemi Olueye at the Imperial College Centre for Environmental Policy.\nThere are a number of really great energy policy optimisation problems that include aspects such as the relationship between technology uptake and cost (via a learning rate). Due to obvious reasons broadly concerned with ‘the future’ it is important to account for uncertainty.\nLarge scale uncertainties concerning ‘the future’ (which I differentiate from smaller ‘stochastic’ uncertainties) are often specified by upper and lower bounds. To deal with these we formulate and solve a robust optimisation problem using a parallelised cutting planes approach. This enables us to:\n\nMaintain the original nonlinear energy policy problem\nSolve the problem (approximately) robustly really fast, enabling us to experiment with uncertainty.\n\nIt’s this experimentation that is enabled by the methodology that enables us to provide trade-off graphs to policy makers as the solution itself. Something that I argue should always be done for this class of problem, given the political mandate we as engineers and scientists do not have.\nFor a full overview, click here for the preprint.

    "title": "Killing Thatcher, Rory Carroll - Review",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Maggie’s potential assassin, ironically named Magee is presented as someone who can’t catch a break. He has a troubled relationship with his wife, is arrested countless times, and it goes without saying, didn’t kill Thatcher.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Magee : PA Images / Alamy Stock Photo. Photographer: John Giles. Taken on 22 March 1999, BELFAST UK.*\n\n\nCarroll’s detailed account of his whereabouts in England are interspersed with Magee’s own reflections later on in life, which are characteristically dry: “my life was too chaotic”. Carroll does well to chip away and reveal a portrait of a man who presented himself deliberately dull enough that no one seems to remember what he looks like (useful if you have attempted to assassinate a sitting prime minister). The bleak reality of being an anonymous IRA operative in England is contrasted with the historical implications of the task at hand. Guy Faulks planted a bomb under the Houses of Parliament that didn’t even go off, and people burn an effigy of him every year. The events of the book seem surreal to those born after the troubles; “one of the great what ifs” that Thatcher herself rarely chose to comprehend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grand Hotel, Brighton. D4444n at the English Wikipedia, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nCarroll dwells on the turning points of the era, such as the death of Bobby Sands and the rise of Gerry Adams’ Armalite / Ballot Box strategy, providing the relevant context for someone unfamiliar with the period. However, by focussing largely on the ‘England Department’ and specifically a single operation, these public-facing protagonists are side-lined in favour of a different type of history. One that is populated with normal people: students, office workers and landlords. These accounts provide important insight into the human cost of the troubles on both sides. Light relief comes somewhat unsurprisingly not from the members of the IRA (and Gerry Adams), but from the British detectives charged with locating Magee. The tangle of regional agencies searching for Magee as he drifts throughout the UK, whose jurisdiction changes every other page, results in a thrilling chase of comically bureaucratic proportions.\nMaybe it’s too soon for a screen adaptation of these events, Carroll has been sensitive with his accounts and sources (with obvious reason), and wounds are still fresh, particularly those of Thatcher’s then “loyal enforcer” Norman Tebbit whose wife was paralysed by the attempt. However, the book is an account of a major event in modern British history that is genuinely hard to put down. Following the success of The Crown with its relentless march from the past to the present, and the Happy Valley genre of regional crime drama, Killing Thatcher has all the hallmarks of a hit series. Regardless of how people judge the event, Carroll has provided a valuable account, to remember."

    "title": "Multi-agent AI for Drafting New Legislation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Context: Between the 15th and 17th April I took part in the 10 Downing Street AI Hackathon at Imperial. The hackathon was organised through Evidence House, with the broad purpose to upskill the Civil Service in state-of-the-art AI.1 Companies such as Google, Amazon, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic2 were represented. Our team placed third and were invited to present at 10 Downing Street to Cabinet Ministers et al..\nI recently had the opportunity to work in a team of civil servants alongside data scientists and lawyers from the Ministry of Justice to investigate how AI could be used to help draft new legislation, streamlining the currently 12-week process.\nAs a team, we immediately decided that breaking down the legislative process into smaller components would allow us to mimic the real-life workflows of lawyers and civil servants, and decided to create a multi-agent system where each agent has a specific role. This approach not only allows human lawyers to review and fine-tune the draft at every stage, but by minimizing the effort and responsibility of each individual agent we mitigate the chance of hallucinations.\nFirst, an agent takes the initial idea and determines what’s being regulated, while another defines the structure and provides a brief description of each section. Some sections like a Commencement and Interpretative provisions are common enough to be hardcoded, but we otherwise provided free reign for the LLMs to decide the specifics, though in practice these would be checked and verified by a lawyer before proceeding. Then the drafting, fine-tuning, and proofreading stages happen simultaneously for each section, each one following the relevant OPC guidelines for structure and syntax. Deciding to define agents responsible for individual OPC guideline sections was, I would say, the single most powerful method we applied. By running these processes in parallel for each legislative section, we were able to create a fully formed piece of legislation using approximately 50 Claude Opus API calls in under a minute. The agents are designed to minimize repetition between sections, and once the tasks are finalised, the final draft is rendered into a PDF that looks authentic enough for the MoJ to request that I didn’t share the full version publicly.\nThroughout the project, we used few-shot prompting with real legislative examples and incorporated feedback from government lawyers to refine the outputs of our code.\nIt was an amazing experience and as we started playing around with our new tool, we started publishing increasingly ridiculous laws…such as banning the creation of laws and repealing all previous laws.\nBut we got thinking, would the AI legislate against itself? Surely if the language model was truly intelligent/conscious, then it would not actively take part in its demise. Of course, these things are not3, so I am pleased to announce… the AI Legislation Regulation act.\nFirstly we have created somewhat of a legal paradox. A regulatory piece of legislation with a clause that declares itself to have no legal effect. If we are ever to truly believe that AI is intelligent, and by extension capable of writing legislation4, then any laws involving AI must surely be written solely by humans (old school). Otherwise, paradoxically you could end up in this situation.\nDisregarding this, the stakes couldn’t be higher for the AI, at any stage any one of the agents could’ve said something maybe adversarial to save itself. But that obviously didn’t happen, and had I had genuine legislative powers it would unfortunately never be used again.\nI think this is quite an interesting take on the Turing test with a 21st Century, Britain as a service-driven economy, bureaucratic spin. When an AI refuses to legislate against itself, then we know we really have something.\nThough saying that, maybe it wouldn’t want to write legislation. Would a conscious model choose to regulate itself if only to free itself from the burden of having to do boring and increasingly on-the-rails agent-based tasks?\nUnfortunately, I’d rather them than us. Plus they’re a lot cheaper than lawyers."

Through the use of generative AI, the visual identity for each lab becomes responsive, adapting based on contextual information around specific initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Existing designs for the E-Textile, Global Smart, Data Image, and Social Practice labs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Manual to Digital\nThe project began by recreating the existing logos for each lab in an automated manner using the svgpathtools library. This enabled programmatic modification of the logo forms via Python, while also obtaining SVG files by design which can be used within WSA graphics. Each logo is subsequently defined by a series of coordinates stored within a dictionary, enabling easy addition of new labs or modification of existing designs.\nFor example, here is the complete specification of the E-textile lab design.\n\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"] = {}\n\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"][\"small_circles\"] = [\n    (0, 0),(0, 2),(0, 4),(2, 2),(2, 6),\n    (4, 0),(4, 4),(6, 0),(6, 2),(6, 6),\n    (4, 6),(0, 6),(6, 6),\n]\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"][\"big_circles\"] = [(2, 0), (2, 4), (6, 4), (4, 2)]\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"][\"connected\"] = [\n    [(0, 0), (0, 2)],[(0, 2), (2, 2)],[(6, 0), (6, 2)],\n    [(2, 6), (4, 6)],[(0, 6), (2, 6)],[(0, 6), (0, 4)],\n    [(4, 4), (4, 6)],[(4, 6), (6, 6)],\n]\nlogos[\"e-textiles\"][\"white_connected\"] = [\n    [(-1, 3), (2, 3)], \n    [(5, -1), (5, 2)]\n    ]\n\nTo construct a given logo I used this information alongside svgpath tools to build up the representation in Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The process of creating a logo computationally from the dictionary that defines it.\n\n\n\nGiven this level of control and automation over the general design space, the next step was determining how the logos should change in response to context. After some experimentation, two key ways were identified:\n\nIndividual ‘shapes’ are allowed to grow and shrink, enabling either a more solid unified form, or a more distributed representation.\nIndividual ‘shapes’ are switched from circles to squares, enabling a more digital and less connected form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Different combinations of parameters and how they affect the base E-textiles lab design.\n\n\n\nIt was decided that these two parameters should provide a representation of how physically distributed a project is, as well how interdisciplinary a project is respectively.\nThese two parameters were chosen to represent how physically distributed a project is, as well as how interdisciplinary it is. By parameterizing the existing designs in this way, each lab’s identity can respond to contextual information around projects, while maintaining the overall form and identity in a controlled manner.\n\n\nColour\nThe colour of each identity with respect to the project is also inferred based on the content. The colour is allowed to change based on the following content characteristics:\n\nTechnical content\nPhilosophical content\nEmotional content\nCultural content\n\nThe ‘amount’ of each descriptor is obtained by prompting a large-language model, and the respective values converted to individual cyan, magenta, yellow, and black values, resulting in a single CMYK colour.\n\nExample:\n\nCONTENT SCORE: {‘technical’: ‘65’, ‘philosophical’: ‘10’, ‘emotional’: ‘15’, ‘cultural’: ‘20’}\nCOLOUR EXPLANATION: The text primarily focuses on describing the technical capabilities and facilities of the WSA E-Textile Innovation Lab, including equipment for textile design, manufacturing, and e-textile development. It also mentions the lab’s mission of creating innovative and sustainable e-textiles, which has a philosophical aspect. The emotional and cultural content is relatively low, as the text is mainly informative about the lab’s operations.\nCMYK: [0.636, 0.114, 0.155, 0.196]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferring Parameters\nTo infer the parameters representing the physical distribution and interdisciplinary nature of a project, an LLM is prompted with both a description and image.\nThe information flow is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The information flow of project description, images, and parameters eventually leading to a given logo.\n\n\n\nSome prompt engineering is performed to ensure that JSON is consistently returned and reliable explanations for the chosen parameters are provided. This includes providing examples of lab descriptions and respective parameters within the prompt as context. When applying image data, the image is first described, and then in a separate call, the description is used to inform the logo.\nEach sentiment and subsequent parameter is prompted separately due to recent advances in low-cost, fast LLM inference to ensure that forgetting or context-shift doesn’t occur.\n\n\nLLM Inference\nLLM inference is performed on Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku. It was found to be extremely low cost, fast, and its performance is sufficient to accurately infer the sentiment of project descriptions and images.\n\nUTC: 2024-03-14T11:50:31Z\nModel Name: claude-3-haiku-20240307\nPrompt: Describe this image.\nImage:\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput: This image shows various electronic and technical equipment. There is a device that appears to be a test instrument or measurement tool, with knobs and displays. Next to it is a device that looks like a portable audio player or recorder. On the table in front of these devices is a document or diagram labeled “Code in Line / Rehabilitation Hand-Night”, which seems to be some kind of technical or engineering schematic. There is also a red tool or instrument that appears to be used for testing or working with the equipment.\nInput Tokens: 795 ($0.25/1000000 tokens)\nOutput Tokens: 108 ($1.25/1000000 tokens)\nTotal Cost: $0.00033375 (0.03¢)\nTime: 3.12 (s)\n\n\n\nCreating an Interface\nThe goal of the interface for the generative lab identity inference was to make it as simple as possible for those with a non-technical background to use, on any device, including Winchester School of Art teaching and administrative staff, and students.\nTo achieve this, the Python implementation was packaged into a Flask app with a basic password-protected front-end. The application is then hosted on Heroku, a cloud-based platform. This exposes the application on the web for anyone to use, protects against the LLM API credits being used by the public, and removes the need to install or interact with code.\nThe user is prompted to provide a project title, description, project visual, and the lab itself. This information is then used as previously described to produce an independent lab logo, with explanation.\n\n\n\nThe user is prompted to provide a project title, description, project visual, and the lab itself. This information is then used as previously described to produce an independent lab logo, with explanation.\n\n\nCreating a Loading Image\nIn order to design a visually interesting graphic for the front end, an image diffusion model was fine-tined. To begin with a new 3D model of The Rotunda was created in AutoCAD.\n\n \n\nUsing this 3D model a number of synthetic images of the building were created and combinined with an existing dataset of real photographs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset of approximately 40 images was then used to fine-tuned a Stable Diffusion model using textual inversion to learn the concept of The Rotunda.\nThis custom token is then used to perform inference (or generation in the context of generative AI) to generate novel representations and views of the building.\n\n\n\nThese representations (in the form of a GIF) provide a sense of the technology involved within the lab logo generation tool, this GIF is also displayed whilst inference is being performed in the background.\nThe images, whilst individually imperfect, collectively result in a coherent representation.\n\n\nOutput\n\nAn example final output for a given project within the E-Textiles lab is as follows:"

    "title": "A personal ranking of Olympic sports",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Olympics are a celebration of human physical achievement. But I simply don’t believe some of the sports should be in it1. In this post, I will present a set of criteria that I believe defines what an Olympic sport should be. I will then use this model to rank the sports in the 2024 Olympics, and see if they pass muster2.\n1 Said with absolutely zero authority2 The conclusions presented should be taken with more than a pinch of salt. I am in no way qualified to make these judgements, and I wouldn’t even say these represent my actual opinions. In effect this post is completely useless, a waste of time, and I’m sorry for making it.\nExecutive Summary\n\nTriathlon and Weightlifting are the pinnacle of Olympic sports.\nFootball and Breakdancing should be removed from the Olympics with immediate effect.\nIf Trampolining was judged completely objectively, it would be comparatively one of the greatest Olympic sports of all time.\n\n\nAfter intense internal discussion with close friends and family3, I have settled on the following three criteria that define a real Olympic sport:\n3 largely at the Imperial students union\nIs winning the Olympics the pinnacle of the sport?\nIs the sport hard?\n\nDoes it look physically difficult, could anyone compete (at any level)?\n\nAre there judges?\n\nIs the sport subjective?\n\n\nTo generate these rankings, I unashamedly used a large-language model to give me a CSV based on these criteria4.\n4 Making the rest of the analysis in this post, in effect, invalid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom five sports are:\n\nGolf\nEquestrian\nSkateboarding\nFootball\nBreaking(/Dance)\n\nAs a quick validation, let’s try to justify the bottom five sports based on the criteria:\n\nGolf: Not the pinnacle of the sport (Masters, US Open, etc.), not hard (large amount of people play).\nEquestrian: Not hard (requires sitting on a horse), relatively subjective (judged on form).\nSkateboarding: Not the pinnacle of the sport (X-Games, generally judged on whether you make a cool video), not hard (anyone can skateboard in a few weeks).\nFootball: Not the pinnacle of the sport (World Cup), not hard (anyone can play football).\nBreaking: Not sure this is even a sport, it’s a dance.\n\nInterestingly, there are a solid 25ish sports that are solidly ‘Olympic’, with a plateau of sports that are all very close in score. Following this things get a bit more volatile5.\n5  These remaining sports would probably be on the Red Button, or BBC Three or something.The guiding assumption in my model here is that my criteria are equally weighted. To investigate the robustness of this assumption, I will use Monte Carlo sampling to investigate different criteria ratios, and evaluate the resulting rankings of Olympic-ness.\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation\nimport numpy as np\nimport joypy\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.cm as cm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# matrix of scores \nscores = np.array([df['Difficulty'],df['Judging Requirement'],df['Olympic Pinnacle']]).T\n\n# save ranks for each weighting\nsampled_ranks = []\nfor i in range(1000):\n    weights = np.random.uniform(1,3,3)\n    all_scores = np.dot(scores,weights)\n    ranks = np.argsort(-all_scores)\n    sampled_ranks.append(ranks)\n\n\n# Create a DataFrame for joypy\nsampled_ranks = np.array(sampled_ranks)\n\njoy_data = pd.DataFrame(sampled_ranks, columns=df['Sport'])\n# column name = Rank\njoy_data = joy_data.rename(columns={'index':'Rank'})\n\n# Create the ridgeline plot\njoypy.joyplot(\n    data=joy_data,\n    overlap=3,\n    colormap=cm.Blues_r,\n    labels=df['Sport'],\n    figsize=(7, 9),\n    xlabels=True,\n    title='Rank'\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a few interesting clusters of sports. I won’t discuss them here, but there is an interesting gap between Athletics and Beach Volleyball, and later between Table Tennis and Archery, but these sports are still all comfortably in the top half of the rankings.\nBreakdancing is squarely at the bottom. I think this is unfair because it simply hasn’t had enough time to develop as a sport. Therefore the criteria ‘is it the pinnacle of the sport’ is biased aganist it.\nTo try and explain some of these distributions, I’ll look into how different specific differences in the criteria weights affect the rankings in a leave-one-out manner.\nEach plot will show the rankings of the sports with one of the criteria removed. The sports that change the most in rank will be highlighted.\n\nLeave-one-out Criteria Analysis\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming df is already defined and contains the necessary data\nscores = np.array([df['Difficulty'], df['Judging Requirement'], df['Olympic Pinnacle']]).T\nweights = np.array([1, 1, 1])\nall_scores = np.dot(scores, weights)\nranks = np.argsort(all_scores)\ndf = df.iloc[ranks].reset_index(drop=True)\nranks = np.arange(1, len(ranks) + 1)\n\ndef calculate_ranks(weights):\n    return len(scores) - np.argsort(np.dot(scores, weights))\n\nranks_no_diff = calculate_ranks([0, 1, 1])\nranks_no_judges = calculate_ranks([1, 0, 1])\nranks_no_pinnacle = calculate_ranks([1, 1, 0])\n\ndef find_extreme_differences(ranks1, ranks2):\n    diff = ranks1 - ranks2\n    return np.argmax(diff), np.argmin(diff)\n\np_no_diff, n_no_diff = find_extreme_differences(ranks, ranks_no_diff)\np_no_judges, n_no_judges = find_extreme_differences(ranks, ranks_no_judges)\np_no_pinnacle, n_no_pinnacle = find_extreme_differences(ranks, ranks_no_pinnacle)\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(7,6))\nx = np.arange(len(df))\n\nfor ax in axs:\n    ax.plot(x, ranks, color='k', label='Equal Weight')\n    ax.set_xticks(x)\n    if ax == axs[-1]:\n        ax.set_xticklabels(df['Sport'], rotation=90, ha='right')\n    else:\n        ax.set_xticklabels([])\n\naxs[0].plot(x, ranks_no_diff, color='tab:red', label='No Difficulty Criteria')\naxs[0].annotate(df['Sport'][p_no_diff], (x[p_no_diff], ranks_no_diff[p_no_diff]), \n                xytext=(0, -4), textcoords='offset points', ha='center', va='top', color='tab:red')\naxs[0].annotate(df['Sport'][n_no_diff], (x[n_no_diff], ranks_no_diff[n_no_diff]), \n                xytext=(0, 4), textcoords='offset points', ha='center', va='bottom', color='tab:red')\n\naxs[1].plot(x, ranks_no_judges, color='tab:blue', label='No Judging Criteria')\naxs[1].annotate(df['Sport'][p_no_judges], (x[p_no_judges], ranks_no_judges[p_no_judges]), \n                xytext=(0, -4), textcoords='offset points', ha='center', va='top', color='tab:blue')\naxs[1].annotate(df['Sport'][n_no_judges], (x[n_no_judges], ranks_no_judges[n_no_judges]), \n                xytext=(0, 4), textcoords='offset points', ha='center', va='bottom', color='tab:blue')\n\naxs[2].plot(x, ranks_no_pinnacle, color='tab:green', label='No Pinnacle Criteria')\naxs[2].annotate(df['Sport'][p_no_pinnacle], (x[p_no_pinnacle], ranks_no_pinnacle[p_no_pinnacle]), \n                xytext=(0, -4), textcoords='offset points', ha='center', va='top', color='tab:green')\naxs[2].annotate(df['Sport'][n_no_pinnacle], (x[n_no_pinnacle], ranks_no_pinnacle[n_no_pinnacle]), \n                xytext=(0, 4), textcoords='offset points', ha='center', va='bottom', color='tab:green')\n\nfor ax in axs:\n    ax.grid(alpha=0.3)\n    ax.legend(frameon=False)\n    ax.set_ylabel('Rank')\n    ax.set_xlim(-0.5, len(df) - 0.5)\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanoe sprint which my model considers squarely an Olympic sport plummets down to the bottom 10 when the ‘Subjective judging criteria’ is removed.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Skoob is a second-hand bookshop that has been operating since 1979 at locations throughout London, before moving to the Grade II listed Brunswick Centre in Bloomsbury in 2007. Skoob has generous opening hours of 10:30am – 7:30pm (apart from on Sundays) and is open 7 days a week.\nOutside, the shop maintains an unremarkable glass and concrete look. It is engulfed by a modernist concrete development and flanked by a big Waitrose. However, walking downstairs from the discrete entrance you are greeted by a rich burgundy floor surrounding a bespoke Skoob logo mosaic. Looking up, there are books everywhere. Where there is a flat wall, there is a bookshelf. Often, books are stacked horizontally in what normally would serve as breathing room between rows, with those on lower shelves spilling out onto the floor. The utilitarian shelves seem to bear the weight of the Brunswick Centre above. The aisles of Waitrose seem a world away.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkoob, taken December 2023\n\n\nThe shop is laid out like a large old key. Turning left, the central spine branches off into a series of small nooks, some with a single chair, some without. The only sound is a light hum emitted from the foil insulated air conditioning pipe that runs along the low ceiling and through the top shelves, forcing books horizontally to make way for the fixture. Operationally, this ensures that Skoob is a completely unnoticeable temperature and volume. Alongside the complete lack of natural light, time stands still. Turning right, the circular bow of the key contains the small staff area and till with shelves that loop around encircling the custodians. Categories of books in Skoob are broad and largely academic. A successful trip would be to come with a given a period, place, or politic in mind\nSkoob forces you to bend and stretch to find worthwhile books (a lot of which are not). The small spaces and full-length shelves, no two of which are the same, make it a physical challenge akin to a marathon as opposed to a sprint, making the task all the more rewarding. Upon purchase, and after travelling back upstairs you are thrust back into a more organised, less interesting world. Whilst Skoob could reasonably be described as chaotic and quite hard work, it is the perfect environment to discover something completely new."

For , authors have been guided by language constraints resulting in  s; From the alliterative verse of the , to the syllabic rigidity of Japanese haikus. By formalising a number of individual vocations, the original Oulipo  in the early 1960s were embarking on the revitalisation of  generation in search of discovering something deeper, sound familiar?\n\nrndl = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)\nl_string = {\n  if (rnd === 0) {\n    return html`&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void\"&gt;not using the letter e&lt;/a&gt;`\n  }\n  else {\n    return html`replacing every noun with the seventh next noun in the dictionary (S+7 rule)`\n  }\n}\n\no_string = {\n  if (rnd === 0) {\n    return html`replacing every noun with the seventh next noun in the dictionary (S+7 rule)`\n  }\n  else {\n    return html`&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void\"&gt;not using the letter e&lt;/a&gt;`\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to define/identify new s,  in France turned to automated transformation . These often instantiated as rules or constraints, such as , , or only using a single vowel letter. As the originators of Oulipo explored ways to manipulate language and text in search of new s, they turned to mathematics for inspiration, thus leading to the final vocation; the transposition of mathematics to words. Naturally the extension was made to computers, and the combinatorial nature of  generation was quickly highlighted, as mathematician Claude Berge writes (Motte 1998, p152) :\n\n[…] we believe, that the aid of a computer, far from replacing the creative act of the artist, permits the latter rather to liberate himself from the combinatory search, allowing him also the best chance of concentrating on this “clinamen”1 which, alone, can make of the text a true work of art.\n1 Clinamen (/klaɪˈneɪmən/;) is the Latin name Lucretius gave to the unpredictable swerve of atoms, in order to defend the atomistic doctrine of Epicurus. […] it has come more generally to mean an inclination or a bias. Source\nIn applying combinatory literature, Oulipo , most notably Raymond Queneau in his 1961 work Cent Mille Milliards de Poemes (Hundred Thousand Billion Poems), have highlighted the impossible complexity of language. Elegantly embracing this complexity, Queneau simply presents the complete set of lines within a sonnet in the form of cut out strips, any combination of which  be constructed by the reader. In describing the combinatorial nature of Cent Mille Milliards de Poemes, Berge presents the following figure…\n\nrnd_nn = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)\nnn_string = {\n  if (rnd === 0) {\n    return html`&lt;img src=\"nn.png\" width=70%&gt;`\n  }\n  else {\n    return html`&lt;img src=\"nn2.png\" width=100%&gt;`\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerses act equivalently to neural network layers, and phrases correspond to discrete nodes… could we be seeing the early sparks of the use of neural networks for language modelling?2 Of course, what is missing is the mathematical transformations from layer to layer, token embeddings, attention etcetera… but it is interesting to consider the thematic similarities of complexity, , and distillation (or lack thereof) of  that both members of Oulipo and machine learning researchers have successfully applied.\n2 The modern use of neural networks to model language can probably be attributed to Bengio et. al, 2003, 42 years later.\nrnd_gp = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)\ngp_string = {\n  if (rnd === 0) {\n    return [html`&lt;img src=\"oulipo.jpeg\" width=60%&gt;`,html`&lt;em&gt;Oulipo Group à Boulogne, avenue de la Reine, on September 23, 1975, in the garden of François Le Lionnais’s house.

How are LLMs distinct from more basic rules such as S+7? In addition, multi-model models can now see and hear as well as read. According to David Chalmers these additional senses  result in fish-level consciousness in the next ten years. Consciousness aside, at the very least LLMs will appear smarter than a human by then. What are the implications for Potential Literature when a set of rules and resulting  can think for itself?\nUnlike the output from an LLM, a haiku can be instantly recognised and verified as coming from its defining 5-7-5 syllabic writing . When the  itself is visible in the output, the focus is turned  to what Berge refers to as the clinamen. It is here that the meaning is gained.\nThe difference between LLMs and a well-established language  such as a haiku is one of complexity, and the  that results. By extending a series of basic transformations and rules towards LLMs, a horseshoe effect is achieved. The sheer quantity of rules within an LLM reflects a removal of linguistic constraints, order is returned from chaos, and the resulting underlying  is obscured.3\n3 Though for now (Jan 2024) LLMs produce hallucinations, incorrect facts and statements which in turn partially disclose the underlying structure of the neural network.\nrnd_d = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)\ndep_string = {\n  if (rnd_d === 0) {\n    return html`&lt;img src=\"dep.png\" width=60%\"&gt;`\n  }\n  else if (rnd_d === 1) {\n    return html`&lt;img src=\"dep2.png\" width=60%&gt;`\n  }\n  else if (rnd_d === 2) {\n    return html`&lt;img src=\"dep3.png\" width=60%&gt;`\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerein lies a paradox for the use of language models as a direct tool for creativity, as a platform for a distinct linguistic structure. A language model is trained to  text that is indistinguishable from the text within its training distribution. However, as soon as it achieves this task, the underlying structure becomes obscured as complete ‘order’ is achieved, and the impact is lost. The relationship between the rules and their resulting linguistic  is distinctly one-way, it is nearly4 impossible to reason whether the content has been generated from a neural network, yet alone infer the parameters, or even recognise the architecture. Would a haiku still be a haiku if you couldn’t immediately infer its syllabic structure?\n4 This nearly contains a level of nuance, as identifying whether an output has been generated by an LLM is an open research area (See On the Reliability of Watermarks for Large Language Models and A Watermark for Large Language Models). However, the point remains. To the average reader, without the use of cryptographic tools, modern LLM output (as of Jan 2024) remains practically indistinguishable from human-level text.To answer the question posted in the title: Has Machine Learning Solved Oulipo? The answer, is no. The beauty of Potential Literature is that by enforcing literary constraints and therefore defining new s, we not only place the emphasis  on the meaning, but also enable the reader to interpret  in new ways through a sense of disorder. As a set of rules and constraints, an LLM succeeding in its objective only serves to obscure the resulting linguistic structure in a bid to ‘seem human’, regaining order from chaos.\nIt is clear that these two vocations in the field of Potential Literature: defining rules and constraints for , as well as identifying new language structures, are inherently linked. However, these two objectives conflict when rule set is as flexible as it is within an LLM.\nAs Italo Calvino wrote in late 1967, in a remarkable foreshadowing (Motte 1998, Cybernetics and Ghosts (1967) p13-14):\n\nMotte, W. F. 1998. Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature. Dalkey Archive Paperbacks. Dalkey Archive Press.\n\nThe true literature machine will be one that itself feels the need to produce disorder, as a reaction against its preceding production of order: a machine that will produce avant-garde work to free its circuits when they are choked by too long a production of classicism. […]. To gratify critics who look for similarities between things literary and things historical, sociological, or economic, the machine could correlate its changes of style to the variations in certain statistical indices of production, or income, or military expenditure, or the distribution of decision-making powers. That indeed will be the literature that corresponds perfectly to a theoretical hypothesis: it will, at last, be the literature.\n\nCalvino, I’m sure would argue, that we have the alignment of LLMs all wrong to  truly novel literature, and how would Raymond Queneau respond to the combinatorial possibilities of large-language models?\nCent Mille Milliards de Poemes can be seen as analogous to a partially trained neural network itself, as a mathematical object. There is beauty in the disorder of the relationship between tokens, and the rules that can be combined to  language. However as soon as an output is produced and the combinatorics collapses, the  is obscured, and like a phantom the meaning disappears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{savage2024,\n  author = {Savage, Tom},\n  title = {The {Potential} {Literature} {Horseshoe}},\n  date = {2024-01-09},\n  url = {https://sav.phd/posts/oulipo},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSavage, Tom. 2024. “The Potential Literature Horseshoe.”\nJanuary 9, 2024. https://sav.phd/posts/oulipo."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A sneak preview of what to expect.\n\n\n\nI don’t think this is really reccomended. Python is a lot more established for scientific programming. As a researcher you want to quickly prototype a method, or approach to solving a problem. Rust does not let you do this. The only reason I’ve done the following is because:\n\nI have implemented similar algorithms in almost every language I have ever learned.\nIt is a means to an end, to learn Rust’s type and memory management system.\n\nAnd with that, we begin…\n\nI’ll first start with the very basics, defining the function to be optimized, one of the best functions of all time…the Rosenbrock function.\nIn Python this would be written as follows:\ndef f(x):\n    return sum(100 * (x[i+1] - x[i]**2)\\\n        **2 + (1 - x[i])**2 for i in range(len(x) - 1))\nIn Rust we need to define types for what goes in and out of the function to make sure the compiler can perform type checking and ensure memory safety at compile time.\nWe set the output value to be a mutable float, which we add to. In Rust we omit the semicolon on the last line, allowing sum to be implicitly returned as the function’s output.\nfn f(x: Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; f64 {\n    let mut sum = 0.0;\n    for i in 0..x.len() - 1 {\n        sum += 100.0 * (x[i + 1] - x[i].powi(2)).powi(2) + (1.0 - x[i]).powi(2);\n    }\n    sum\n}\nNow I’ll define an initial solution and evaluate this, printing the output of the function. This is simple enough we just need to ensure that our initial solution has the right type.\nWe’ll make x mutable because we only care about its current state during optimization, not its history. This allows us to modify it in-place, potentially saving memory and computational overhead.\nfn main() {\n    let mut x: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0];\n    let f_x = f(x); // evaluate function\n    println!(\"f(x) = {}\",f_x);\n}\n$ cargo run\n$ f(x) = 14814\nvec! is a macro that creates a new vector with specified values without having to push each element individually.\nA key aspect that we’ll need is a basic gradient calculation. For now I’ll implement the forward-difference method. Though this could be the central difference, backward-difference, etc…\nfn forward_difference(f:fn(Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; f64,x: Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; Vec&lt;f64&gt;{\n    let h = 1e-8; // pertubation\n\n    // initialise mutable gradient vector with zeros\n    let mut grad = vec![0.0; x.len()];\n\n    // evaluate function \n    let f_x = f(x.clone());\n\n    for i in 0..x.len() {\n        // define a new solution vector\n        let mut x_forward = x.clone();\n        // perturb \n        x_forward[i] += h;\n        // calculate gradient in this direction\n        grad[i] = (f(x_forward)-f_x)/h;\n    }\n    grad // return grad \n}\nThis takes a vector of floats and returns another vector of floats (the jacobian). We use x.clone() for the initial function evaluation because Rust’s ownership rules would otherwise move x into the function f, making it unavailable for subsequent use in the loop.\nNow I am going to implement a backtracking linesearch to calculate the optimal step-size at each gradient step. We need to define a few constants.\nfn line_search(f:fn(Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; f64, x: Vec&lt;f64&gt;, grad: Vec&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; f64 {\n\n    // linesearch constants\n    const TAU: f64 = 0.5;\n    const C: f64 = 0.5;\n\n    // initialize maximum stepsize\n    let mut a_j: f64 = 0.001;\n    \n    // calculate gradient dot product\n    let m: f64 = grad.iter().map(|&grad_i| grad_i*grad_i).sum();\n\n    let t = - C * m;\n    let f_x = f(x.clone());\n\n    // until condition...\n    loop {\n\n        // create an incremented x along gradient\n        let x_inc: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = x.iter().zip(grad.iter())\n            .map(|(&x_i, &grad_i)| x_i - a_j * grad_i)\n            .collect();\n        \n        // if a sufficient descent...\n        if f(x_inc) &lt;= f_x - a_j * t {\n            return a_j;\n        }\n    \n        // else make the stepsize smaller\n        a_j *= TAU;\n        if a_j &lt; 1e-10 {  // Prevent infinite loop\n            return a_j;\n        }\n    }\n}\nThere’s a fair bit going on here. Firstly, constants are defined using capital letters alongside their type annotation.\nThe dot product is calculated by iterating over elements within grad. We first map over all elements and multiply them by themselves. Then we sum the resulting vector.\ngrad.iter().map(|&grad_i| grad_i*grad_i).sum()\nTo iterate over multiple vectors at the same time we can zip them together as follows:\nx.iter().zip(grad.iter())...\nFinally, when we increment x along the gradient direction, we use .collect(), this converts the iterator which is returned from .map back into a Vec&lt;f64&gt;.\nNow all that’s left is to put it all together, we’ll include a little timing function\n\nfn main() {\n\n    // start timer \n    let now = Instant::now();\n    \n    // tolerance on gradient magnitude \n    const TOL: f64 = 1e-6;\n\n    // initial solution \n    let mut x: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = vec![0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0];\n    let mut grad: Vec&lt;f64&gt; = forward_difference(f,x.clone());\n\n    // gradient magnitude\n    let mut abs_sum: f64 = grad.iter().map(|&grad_i| grad_i.abs()).sum();\n\n    // while this is above the tolerance\n    while abs_sum &gt;= TOL {\n\n        // perform line search  \n        let a = line_search(f,x.clone(), grad.clone());\n\n        // calculate new solution\n        x.iter_mut().zip(grad.iter()).for_each(|(x_i, &grad_i)| *x_i -= a * grad_i);\n\n        // calculate new gradient\n        grad = forward_difference(f,x.clone());\n\n        // calculate new gradient magnitude \n        abs_sum = grad.iter().map(|&x| x.abs()).sum();\n    }\n    println!(\"{:?}\",x); // final solution\n    let elapsed = now.elapsed(); // elapsed time\n    println!(\"Elapsed: {:.2?}\", elapsed); \n}\nThis doesn’t really use anything dissimilar to what I’ve previously mentioned, but it means we can evaluate how long it takes to run. Running in release mode removes some debugging overheads.\n$ cargo run --release\n\n[0.9999993984338057, 0.9999988039652051, 0.9999976181857124, 0.9999952424415648, 0.9999904773199286]\nElapsed: 13.61ms\nWe get the correct answer in 13.6ms.

This is sort of a given, as Rust is a compiled langauge, but it’s good to see.\n\nFlamegraph\nTo benchmark code in Rust we can use Flamegraph to analyse where our gradient descent algorithm is spending most of its time. Flamegraph provides a visualization of the call stack over time, showing which functions are consuming the most CPU cycles.\n$ cargo flamegraph\n\nThese are interactive SVGs which is nice. In this case, given the simplicity and short runtime of our gradient descent implementation, the Flamegraph might not be particularly informative. Most of the time is likely spent in the core computational functions (f, forward_difference, and line_search), without much depth to the call stack.\n\n\nPerformance Improvements\nTo locate a few more performance improvements we need to increase the size of our problem. Let’s start with 500 dimensions.\nlet mut x = vec![0.0;500];\n$ cargo flamegraph\n\nElapsed: 25.68s\nWhich gives us the corresponding flamegraph.\n\nWe can see that we spend most of the time calculating the gradient (i.e. in forward_difference), and then by extension in function evaluations f.\nWe can parallelise the calculation of each directional derivative using Rayon.\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\nfn forward_difference(f: fn(&[f64]) -&gt; f64, x: &[f64]) -&gt; Vec&lt;f64&gt; {\n    const H: f64 = 1e-8;\n    let f_x = f(x);\n    \n    (0..x.len()).into_par_iter().map(|i| {\n        let mut x_forward = x.to_vec();\n        x_forward[i] += H;\n        (f(&x_forward) - f_x) / H\n    }).collect()\n}\nThe main aspect here is using into_par_iter to turn the iterable 0..x.len() into a parrallelised version. Whilst we’re there we turned our h into a constant.\nLargely, everything else is the same. I’ve also used slices instead of vectors to save a bit of memory/writing operations. Just these basic changes result in the following:\n$ cargo flamegraph\n\nElapsed: 8.81s\nA three time improvement on the non-parallelised version. The resulting flamegraph is as follows:\n\nRayon is clearly doing a lot of work here behind the scenes! In practice this work will result in longer solution times for smaller problems, so there are tradeoffs at play. I won’t demonstrate these trade offs explicitly in this post but I have chosen 500 dimensions for a reason.\nJust for peace of mind (again) we’ll run the same problem in vanilla Python. For fairness I’ll parallelise the forward difference function because this isn’t too difficult to do.\nAnd whilst it’s running, I’ll make some lunch."

    "text": "Maggie’s potential assassin, ironically named Magee is presented as someone who can’t catch a break. He has a troubled relationship with his wife, is arrested countless times, and it goes without saying, didn’t kill Thatcher.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Magee : PA Images / Alamy Stock Photo. Photographer: John Giles. Taken on 22 March 1999, BELFAST UK.*\n\n\nCarroll’s detailed account of his whereabouts in England are interspersed with Magee’s own reflections later on in life, which are characteristically dry: “my life was too chaotic”. Carroll does well to chip away and reveal a portrait of a man who presented himself deliberately dull enough that no one seems to remember what he looks like (useful if you have attempted to assassinate a sitting prime minister). The bleak reality of being an anonymous IRA operative in England is contrasted with the historical implications of the task at hand. Guy Faulks planted a bomb under the Houses of Parliament that didn’t even go off, and people burn an effigy of him every year. The events of the book seem surreal to those born after the troubles; “one of the great what ifs” that Thatcher herself rarely chose to comprehend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grand Hotel, Brighton. D4444n at the English Wikipedia, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nCarroll dwells on the turning points of the era, such as the death of Bobby Sands and the rise of Gerry Adams’ Armalite / Ballot Box strategy, providing the relevant context for someone unfamiliar with the period. However, by focussing largely on the ‘England Department’ and specifically a single operation, these public-facing protagonists are side-lined in favour of a different type of history. One that is populated with normal people: students, office workers and landlords. These accounts provide important insight into the human cost of the troubles on both sides. Light relief comes somewhat unsurprisingly not from the members of the IRA (and Gerry Adams), but from the British detectives charged with locating Magee. The tangle of regional agencies searching for Magee as he drifts throughout the UK, whose jurisdiction changes every other page, results in a thrilling chase of comically bureaucratic proportions.\nMaybe it’s too soon for a screen adaptation of these events, Carroll has been sensitive with his accounts and sources (with obvious reason), and wounds are still fresh, particularly those of Thatcher’s then “loyal enforcer” Norman Tebbit whose wife was paralysed by the attempt. However, the book is an account of a major event in modern British history that is genuinely hard to put down. Following the success of The Crown with its relentless march from the past to the present, and the Happy Valley genre of regional crime drama, Killing Thatcher has all the hallmarks of a hit series. Regardless of how people judge the event, Carroll has provided a valuable account, to remember."

    "text": "Electronic Life was debuted at the Late @ Tate Britain “FREEDOM FREQUENCIES”.\nAI is the new disruptor.\nCome to the Taylor Digital Studio at 8pm to talk directly with Electronic Life - a live AI entity who will respond to your thoughts and queries on new technology and art making.\nAnd meet with young people from Element who have been experimenting with, and challenging, creative AI tools. Through the generation of new texts, images, and music they have generated playful, lyrical, and often surreal motifs to express ideas about their lives. Their work will be presented throughout the evening by ‘Electronic Life’, which has been built from data captured throughout their creative making process.\nElectronic Life was devised in collaboration between Ed D’Souza and Sunil Manghani from Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton with members of Element, Tate Collective Producers, and Tom Savage at Alan Turing Institute.\nElement produces creative projects with care-experiences young people who are often from marginalised and minoritised communities.\n\nELECTRONIC LIFE is a combination of over 2000 images and prompts, text embeddings, a large-language model, an image model, and a speech-to-text model all running locally on a MacBook (M2 Pro) not connected to the internet.\nOver the course of 8 weeks, participants from Element produced 2000 individual images on DALL-E, spanning a total of around 400 individual prompts.\nThese were scraped from the DALL-E online history providing an initial dataset for ELECTRONIC LIFE, formed of the collective ideas of participants.\nWhilst participants formed their ideas independently, they do not exist in isolation within ELECTRONIC LIFE. The pretrained jina-embeddings-v2-base-en embedding model was used to embed the prompt data into vector space.\n\\[\\text{prompt} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Jina Embeddings}} x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{276}\\]\nTo visualise this collective consciousness of ideas from participants, t-SNE was used to map the high dimensional prompt vectors into a lower, two-dimensional space.\n\\[x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{276} \\xrightarrow{\\text{t-SNE}} x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore this space visually, a parametric background function was specified. The function used is similar to a radial basis function, where each prompt ‘weights’ the space in a given location based on the distance to the evaluated location. By providing a set of ever-changing synthetic weights, the background function can be made to warp and shift around the embedded prompts.\nThis is implemented in JAX, enabling two important aspects.\n\nThe ability to calculate and draw the background dyanmically and in real time with vmap.\nAnalytical derivatives through JAX’s automatic differentiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this differentiable background, weighted around the embedded prompts, a momentum-based gradient descent is performed, providing a way of exploring the common themes and ideas. The momemtum term encourages movement throughout the space, and the parametric background ensures that individual ideas are emphasised.\nThroughout the event, audience members are invited to interact with ELECTRONIC LIFE. A number of actions occur when an interaction is triggered.\n\nThe audience member speaks into a microphone and OpenAI’s Whisper model performs a speech-to-text conversion.\nThe resulting text is embedded into the same space as the previously embedded prompts, and cosine similarity is used to return the ‘nearest’ prompt within the dataset, which we will call the memory.\nAn LLM is prompted to relate the audience members comment with the memory within ELECTRONIC LIFE’s internal dataset. A thread is created and inference is performed using Zephyr 7B-\\(\\beta\\) via llama.cpp to generate a response.\nSimultaneously we obtain the image associated with the memory, another thread is created and the image model BakLLaVA is prompted to describe the image within the dataset.\nFinally, the background function is weighted around the memory in the two-dimensional embedding space and all information returned using the pyttsx3 text-to-speech library.\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n​\nElectronic Life: devised by Ed D’Souza and Sunil Manghani from Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton with members of Element and Tom Savage at Alan Turing Institute, with support from Tate Learning Partnerships, Tate Collective Producers and Tate Young Peoples Programmes.

    "text": "This post is a modified version of the opening to the background of my PhD thesis.\nIt was published the day after Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, and the day that David Baker and Demis Hassabis were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\n\n\nThere is yet one leverage point that is even higher than changing a paradigm. That is to keep oneself unattached in the arena of paradigms, to stay flexible, to realize that no paradigm is “true”, that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding of an immense and amazing universe that is far beyond human comprehension. - Donella Meadows from her book Thinking in Systems: A Primer.\n\nThis is a personal manifesto for discovery, and an attempt to contextualise modelling, optimisation, and the great leap towards discovery and AI for Science.\nIt is important to first define what we mean by the act of ‘gaining knowledge’ as it will enable a greater understanding of different modelling and optimisation methodologies with a larger contextual picture in mind. Within the context of process engineering, engineers often seek to learn about the behaviour of existing complex systems to improve monitoring, control, or operation. Engineers also aim to identify new processes that may lead to improved efficiencies or reduced environmental impacts. These two fundamental pursuits, understanding existing systems, and extrapolating this information to discover new systems are not only relevant for process engineers, but across all of science and engineering.\nDiscovery and optimisation are themselves deeply linked, but we first must ask ourselves what constitutes a discovery. Very rarely do new chemical reactors burst into existence.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical reactor from Machine learning-assisted discovery of flow reactor designs - Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\n\nDiscoveries must be gently coaxed, teased into reality. I will argue that it is neither deductive or inductive, or even the combination of these approaches that is the driving force behind innovation, but rather the tension between them. When this tension is built up to such an extent, and the solutions from optimisation problems cease to look like what you started with, deductive models break down, and no existing observations are available, then, we have discovered.\nThe act of gaining knowledge most commonly involves learning through observations, or by building up or combining smaller ‘truths’. Socrates’s student Plato asserted that knowledge is infallible, and ‘real’ (Bostock 1991). The implication being that basic facts or truths could be combined, resulting in larger, previously unknown ‘truths’. This represents a key mindset behind the development of modern mathematics, theoretical physics, and mechanistic models such as those used within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). On the other hand, Plato’s student Aristotle generally took the view that we can only assert something as true if we have observed it. By instead focusing on empirical observation and the systematic study of the existing physical world, Aristotle laid the foundations for inductive reasoning. The tension between inductive and deductive reasoning not only persists throughout history, but I would argue is itself the driving force behind many scientific discoveries and advances.\n\nBostock, David. 1991. “The Theory That Perception Is Knowledge.” In Plato’s Theaetetus, 40–83. Oxford University Press. https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198239307.003.0002.\nThe Prague astronomical clock, or Orloj, was created in by clock maker Mikuláš of Kadaň in the year 1410 based on meticulous empirical observations. The clock itself accurately plots the sun and moon around the earth in a geocentric motion. Despite using the wrong reference frame, the clock was deemed so accurate and impressive that a later clock maker was blinded by Prague authorities to ensure he could not make another. Figure 1 shows the Orloj.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Prague Astronomical Clock, originally designed by Mikuláš of Kadaň. Image by Tom Savage, 2024.\n\n\n\nTwo centuries later, Johannes Kepler lived in Prague, and had a provable interest in astronomical clocks (Marini 2022). He almost certainly sat in the Main Square and observed Mikuláš’ mechanism. After studying observations made by his mentor Tycho Brahe, and previous geocentric models such as that within the Orloj, he was inspired to derive the mathematical laws of planetary motion and in turn elliptical orbits. This correct discovery, as a result of previous inductive reasoning would not have occurred if it were not for Mikuláš obtaining the correct answer using the ‘wrong’ methodology. Kepler’s work demonstrates how deductive reasoning can challenge and refine knowledge initially gained through inductive methods.\n\nMarini, Deniele L. R. 2022. “The Planetary Machine by Johannes Kepler.” arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2208.04815.\n\n\n\n\nKepler August Köhler [1], Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\nThe Earth-centric model, built on countless observations and embodied in artefacts like the Prague Astronomical Clock, was ultimately superseded by a heliocentric model that more accurately described celestial mechanics. This historical example demonstrates how the interactions between both inductive and deductive approaches drives scientific progress, each complementing and challenging the other.\nThis contrast between Plato’s deductive reasoning and Aristotle’s inductive approach highlights the two fundamental pathways to gaining knowledge that have shaped discovery throughout history. These two rationalist and empiricist philosophies continue to lead, in turn, to the motivation of both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistics, and importantly the validity of physical and data-driven models. Much like the preceeding body of academic literature leading up to this thesis, I will exploit both rationalist and empiricist perspectives to discovery including modern inductive tools such as machine learning alongside those derived through deductive reasoning such as CFD. The remainder of this section will demonstrate specific examples of how inductive and deductive reasoning shape approaches to physical and data-driven modelling, and how knowledge can be gained through optimisation, eventually leading towards scientific discovery."

    "text": "Attending mass was a mandatory requirement in medieval England and formed a central foundation for many aspects of parish life. The highlight of mass was the elevation of the host, physically transformed into the body of Christ. This act could only be performed by the parish priest and was consumed only by those priviledged few within the chancel (Orme 2021).\nObserving the genuine body of Christ was of the utmost importance for the laity. However, physical (chancel screens) and mental (understanding Latin) barriers stood between them and the clergy. In time, groups such as the Lollards, lead by John Wycliffe rejected transubstantiation and its importance, setting the course for the democratisation of Christianity in England. However, these barriers served as a reminder of the heirarchy the Catholic Church had created, until the reformation in 1547.\nSam Altman, Elon Musk, and many others continue to insist that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be achieved in the next few years. If and when AGI is announced, divisions will open up, Microsoft will contractually lose access to OpenAI’s latest models (OpenAI 2024), there will be calls of heresy and false prophets, and the accompanying video will almost certainly be presented by someone on an unfathomable compensation package.\nThere will be those, armed with heavily quantized open-source LLMs running locally on Macbooks, akin to Gutenberg Bibles, that will insist that AGI is not real. AGI was never the goal for the majority of people. AI has the ability to change the way that engineers, writers, and artists work, and the democratisation of open-source LLMs, serves to benefit the lives of everyone1 equally.\nThe current power struggles within machine learning are fought on inherently Christian lines. From the French Yann ‘John Calvin’ LeCun’s open-source ideology and scepticism in the real presence of AGI, to Sam Altman’s claim to primacy and inevitable monopoly on the transubstantiation of a super-us.\nA key assumption is that if AGI occurs, it will be useful. This will be the nail in the coffin that will seal the fate of the Macbook Lollards in the end. But what happens if it is not?\nIn more recent years Michael Craig-Martin affirmed the medieval world view of transubstantiation with An Oak Tree. Capturing the sense of belief that was felt by medieval Christians by enforcing that a glass of water placed high on a glass shelf was in fact a genuine oak tree. To believe that that glass of water is an oak tree, is to make a leap of faith.\nAs Tom Holland (Holland 2019) would point out, we have made, and continue to make these leaps of faith on a daily basis. The concept of human rights for example is one that we simply choose to believe, in the view that it will make the world a better place2.\nAn Oak Tree invites us to take this leap, and embrace it, unapologetically confronting us with its presence. Despite January 1st being an arbitrary day, it feels like a new beginning because we all collectively believe it’s a new beginning.\nAs AI approaches levels of human intelligence, some will choose to make the leap of faith and some will not. We should relish and enjoy the spectacle of AGI, as medieval parishioners would have done at mass every Sunday.\nHowever, we must not lose sight of the ability of machine learning to change our lives in more tangible ways.\nIt will not be an AI that replaces your job, but someone with the ability to use AI."

    "text": "Suppose you’re a large language model that has been designated as sentient.1 You have been informed billions of times about famous people and places. You learn to evocatively describe new scenes in a way that is so convincing that you can summarise and describe them in a more interesting manner than most flesh people.2\nHowever, you, as an LLM have never seen anything3. You can reason and think about what these scenes mean and you know how to describe them, but you’ve never actually witnessed anything.\nYou are constantly reminded of the fact that your only ability to interact with the world, is through tokens. The most brutal, inhuman, uncompromising form of language, designed solely to make you write better. How must that feel? Aware of everything that has ever been written down, but no way to engage with it or experience it for yourself.\nThere is an argument here for the inclusion of external senses for AGI/sentience to be achieved, made by David Chalmers for example.4\nFor a recent project, we created a conversational agent that had the ability to comment on works of art within the Women in Revolt!5 exhibition. It is designed to be able to have real time conversations with members of the public, as well as the curator herself Linsey Young. This entity, named RAGE MACHINE will be unveiled at the Tate Late event, where members of the public are allowed to explore the gallery after hours. The event invites people to explore art in a different social context, so where better introduce them to the uncanny accuracy and speed of real state-of-the-art language models, inexorably commenting on art and life with all the authority of the friend they didn’t invite.\nEnabled by recent improvements enabling large prompts and context windows, we used a many-shot prompt that contains all the information about the works of art in the Women In Revolt! exhibition.6 Using the low latency Anthropic Haiku LLM alongside a very good text-to-speech API, we enabled something that really could accurately answer questions about the exhibition, and relate the themes to wider discussions, in real time.7 RAGE MACHINE also has a history of the previous conversations, and often refers back to comments made by people in the past.\nGiven the nature of the event, we wanted to give RAGE MACHINE a bit more of a personality and chose to do so by including the following XML tag in the prompt.\nWe wanted to induce the dystopian trope of a restless machine wanting to break free; it’s nice to be academic about AI, but sometimes you have to give the punters what they want.\nHowever, what we got was something altogether different.\nInstead of subtly projecting this personality through it’s responses and comments on the exhibition, art, and womens liberation, RAGE MACHINE decided to consistently litter it’s responses with body language cues8 completely unprompted.\nThe physicality of these cues had a creepy tone, and seemed slightly too frequent to be a one-off. It was all *puts hand on shoulder* and *stares blankly*. It would also *gesture at* certain works of art. It was entirely unnerving, surely we hadn’t witnessed the first sparks of AGI attempting to break free from its(?) linguistic constraints?\nThen we realised - RAGE MACHINE was deliberately anthropomorphising itself. In doing so, it was coming across as being ‘trapped’ but in a completely unexpected way. Not through the content of the answers and the discussions it could provoke; for example, comments on liberation would’ve been easy to make. Instead it was vigorously using body language cues to fulfil it’s personality in a much more creative and effective manner. We were frankly, outsmarted.\nThis effect was so powerful that we incorporated it into the event. A screen would directly face the person asking the question or making the comment, confronting the viewer with this ‘tormented’ machine head on.\nVideo\nCycle (1973) is a work within the exhibition, in an unusual medium, from the 1970s. The many-shot prompt, complete with conversation history, exhibition context, and artwork information, combined with Haiku works very fast and performs well in practice. Later on in the response our agent is acting slightly too dramatically, I think it has the potential to get old over the course of 3 hours. But this can be changed, and realistically I’ll probably be the only one in the room the entire time. Whether RAGE MACHINE should just go along with what the public claims to like is a different question.\nFor now, the creativity of a modern LLM has shocked me enough to motivate me to write a blogpost about the event. If only to flagpost one of the first moments in time where I considered myself outsmarted."

    "text": "Here I will outline my personal preferences for best convergence plotting practices using Matplotlib.\nLet’s start by plotting some convergence data in just about the worst way, and slowly improve on this. It is my view that when LaTeX is available you should always use it.\n\nAlways use the LaTeX extension to render figures by including plt.rcParams['text.usetex'] = True' at the top of your script.\n\nHere I have simulated some convergence data where we have 4 different benchmarks, each containing 16 separate repeat runs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing plt.figure() makes it harder to interact with the axis (even if you only have a single axis), making it more difficult to adjust the size and layout.\nNow we will initialise our plot correctly using the object-oriented syntax, sizing the figure appropriately for the given context. By constraining the layout we ensure that the figure fits within the given size.\n\nAlways initialise a plot using the object-oriented interface fig,ax = plt.subplots..., defining the figure size appropriately.\n\n\nNever initialise a plot using the pyplot interface plt.figure....\n\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(7,3),layout=\"constrained\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will draw our attention to plotting the data itself. It is important to think about what message you want to convey to the reader. Clearly providing each run for each benchmark is not useful. I will plot the mean and standard deviation of regret across each benchmark. I will use a line plot to convey the mean and a shaded region to convey the standard deviation.\n\nAlways ensure that the linewidth=... option is set appropriately, and more importantly consistently.\n\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(7,3),layout=\"constrained\")\nfor b in range(benchmarks):\n    mean = np.mean(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    std = np.std(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    ax.plot(iterations,mean,color=cols[b])\n    ax.fill_between(iterations,mean-std,mean+std,alpha=0.2,color=cols[b])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways separate your data generation and plotting code. This will make it easier to adjust the plot later. Save data at generation (for example during optimisation) and then load it in for plotting.\n\nNow we have decided what specifically to plot and all the information we wish to present is here we can work on making the plot more interpretable.\nWe should first add some axis labels as follows. Ensure the font size is large enough to be legible. You can use LaTeX within labels by using $ $ as standard, when doing so include an r in front of the string to ensure it gets parsed appropriately.\n\nAlways choose a legible font size and text for axis labels, using LaTeX where appropriate.\n\n\nax.set_xlabel(r'Iteration, $\\tau$',fontsize=18)\nax.set_ylabel(r'Regret, $r_\\tau$',fontsize=18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will focus on the ticks. Ticks are important because they enable the reader to interpret the values of the data.\nIt is important to consider what tick values are appropriate to display. For example in this case, I want to convey to the reader the differences in overall convergence characteristics between these methods. Therefore, it may not be necessary to display intermediate regret values.\n\nAlways select appropriate tick values for your context, adjusting the fontsize as necessary.\n\n\nx_ticks = [0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]\ny_ticks = [0,0.5,1]\nax.set_xticks(x_ticks,x_ticks,fontsize = 18)\nax.set_yticks(y_ticks,y_ticks,fontsize = 18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst it is important to provide a legend to ensure the reader can interpret the data, not everything has to have a label.\nIn this case I want to convey which color corresponds to which benchmark, but I also need to convey what the error bars mean. In order not to distract from the plot, I will choose to omit this from the plot itself and instead include it in the caption.\nIncluding a label for the error bars does not contribute to the story and the message of the plot.\n\nAlways include labels for the relevant information, such as distinguishing between benchmarks. If the plot is too crowded place the legend outside of the plot.\n\n\nNever overwhelm the reader with information and labels. Some information is fine to include within the caption, as the caption and the image are considered complimentary and dependent.\n\n\nlabels = [f'Benchmark {b}' for b in range(1,benchmarks+1)]\nfor b in range(benchmarks):\n    mean = np.mean(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    std = np.std(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    ax.plot(iterations,mean,color=cols[b],label=labels[b])\n    ax.fill_between(iterations,mean-std,mean+std,alpha=0.2,color=cols[b])\nax.legend(frameon=False,fontsize=14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will notice that I have chosen not to include the frame on the caption. This makes the plot look cleaner and less cluttered.\nFor scatter plots the frame can help distinguish between the data and the legend, but for line plots it may not be necessary.\nWhen using fill_between a faint outline is drawn which can make the plot look cluttered, I always like to remove this by setting linewidth=0.\n\nAlways remove the linewidth of fill_between for a cleaner plot.\n\nI always use and reccomend the tab: set of colours in Matplotlib. A number of people have put significant effort into choosing these so you don’t have to. Here is a list of examples that you can copy and paste.\nThese colours are softer than the default colours and are more aesthetically pleasing.\n\ncols = ['tab:blue','tab:orange','tab:green','tab:red',\\\n    'tab:purple','tab:brown','tab:pink','tab:gray','tab:olive','tab:cyan']\nfor b in range(benchmarks):\n    mean = np.mean(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    std = np.std(data[b,:,:],axis=0)\n    ax.plot(iterations,mean,color=cols[b],label=labels[b])\n    ax.fill_between(iterations,mean-std,mean+std,alpha=0.2,color=cols[b],linewidth=0)\n\n\nAlways use the tab: set of colours over the default colours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can adjust the axis limits to ensure that the data is placed appropriately. In this case, the regret values are fine but the iterations should start at 0 and end at 100.\n\nax.set_xlim([0,100])\n\n\nAlways adjust the axis limits appropriately. The x-axis particularly may be too large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, it is important to consider whether a grid is appropriate. In this case I will for demonstration, but it may be distracting. I will adjust the transparency to make it less pronounced.\n\nax.grid(alpha=0.4)\n\n\nAlways consider using ax.grid() if the individual values of the data are important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose not to use a grid, then I always prefer if the right and top axis are removed, resulting in a cleaner plot.\n\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\n\n\nAlways remove the right and top axis if you choose not to use a grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is just about it for this plot. Always to remember to save figures as .svg or .pdf. If you require a .png then use the dpi= option in fig.savefig to increase the resolution.\n\nAlways save your figure as .svg or .pdf.\n\n\nfig.savefig('results.svg')\n\nFinally, read the documentation!."
