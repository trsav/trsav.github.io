Must have net vorticity $\\rightarrow$ net circulation. i.e. fluid is swirling continuously within the vortex core and potential flow regions (inflow or outflow) are therefore excluded. A _potential vortex_ has zero-cross section (i.e. the middle of the vortex?).\n\n2. Geometry should be Galilean invariant. i.e. regardless of how 'fast time is going' the vortex core should remain the same shape. \n\n<!-- images to help here -->\nInadequacies of intuitive measures\n\n1. **Pressure minimum**\n- In 3D pressure may be minimised at a point, or a plane.\n- Able to derive irrotational flows that have minimum pressure planes despite having no vorticity or swirl. \n\n$$u_r = -a(t)r, \\; u_z = 2a(t)z, \\; u_{\\theta} = 0$$\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=389 height=389}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- In Stokes flow at low $Re$, pressure gradient is balanced by the viscosity term. Vortices can be formed, whilst pressure is defined only by viscosity (i.e. constant with no minima).\n- Isopressure surfaces do not correspond with vortical surfaces due to scale difference.\n\n2. **Closed or spiralling streamlines and pathlines**\n- Pathlines do not satisfy Galilean invariance. \n  - Two or more vortices at different speeds in the same reference frame would be obscured.\n- A particle may not complete a full revolution of the vortex centre during the lifetime of a vortex. \n\n3. **Isovorticity surfaces**\n- Vorticity sheets are not a vortex despite having large vorticity.\n- If the background shear is comparable to vorcitiy magnitude vortex cores can be missed.\n\nPreviously proposed definitions (satisfying Galilean-invarance)\n\n1. Complex eigenvalues ($\\sigma$) of the velocity gradient tensor ($\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$).\n\nComplex eigenvalues imply that the local streamline pattern is closed or spirals within a reference frame moving with a point. \n\n",
