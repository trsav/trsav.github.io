How someone organises, or chooses not to organise a bookshelf can say a lot about them. I personally don't think there is any sense in enforcing a specific order. My strategy can be summarised as 'vibes based'. There is joy in being able to know roughly where a book is and pick it out mid conversation. It makes me feel like I'm some sort of magician or an old librarian, holding the secret mental key that will unscramble order from chaos. 

But, if you don't believe in this serendipity, you might be inclined to choose _something_ to base the order on. Given we are pretty good at remembering the title of a book, maybe alphabetical order is good. Actually, authors should be grouped together, so let's make them alphabetical. What about we do that and then also group some categories of similar books together (S/O Dewey). The most intelligent of us out there may choose to forego any sense of useful meaning, and satirically choose to base the order on the colour of the cover, subverting the old book judging adage.

These approaches have been discussed at length [here](https://www.clutter.com/blog/posts/how-to-organize-book-collection/) [here](https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2022/01/bookshelf-organising-tips-books-home-library) [here](https://www.neathousesweethome.com/aesthetic-ways-to-organize-bookshelves/) [here](https://bookriot.com/how-to-organize-bookshelves/) and [here](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/g35578167/how-to-organize-bookshelves/), you get the idea. The reason they're up for debate is because none of them are truly _optimal._ None take advantage of all the available information... **Until now.** Later on in this post I will describe an optimal strategy to sorting a book collection that I've also made open source, but first we must collect some data. 

Digitising all the books I own is a task low down on my todo list (compared to finishing my PhD). So to aid in this, I created a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to help me. It's available [here](https://github.com/trsav/bookshelf/tree/main) and I've creatively named it `optimal-bookshelf`. It allows you to add books to a persistent locally-stored virtual library by searching for a title using open book APIs (i.e. Google Books), after which a more thorough search is performed and the specific edition can be selected. Ideally most of the information is correct at this point, but you then have the option to edit specific data such as the ISBN. I tailored this tool as I was digitising my collection, so it should be as efficient as possible on the Pareto curve of information vs time.

This enabled me to create an accurate digital representation of all the books I own, down to the specific edition, in a relatively short amount of time.

But what to do with this wealth of information? Well, for now it is largely text-based. To do anything that will concern a notion optimality, we need _numbers_. It follows that we can summarise **all** the information that we have generated, and result in a numerical representation by creating _embeddings_ of our virtualised book-twins. By tokenising the information, embeddings represent text as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space using models trained specifically for this purpose. These embedding models are designed to capture semantic relationships between words and phrases, allowing us to perform mathematical operations that measure how similar different pieces of text are to each other. In the `optimal-bookshelf` CLI, embeddings are created using OpenAI's` text-embedding-3-large` model and can easily be generated using the `$ bookshelf embed` command. 

If I make the assumption that I want books near each other to be semantically related (i.e. have a low Euclidian distance in embedding space), and that every book must appear on my bookshelf exactly once, I can equivalently formulate this task as an optimisation problem, minimising the total distance travelled by traversing from embedding to embedding. In this case I don't mind that this trip isn't a loop (because my bookshelf is a 'line' and not a circle, but this can be revisited later), resulting in a formulation of the classic integer programming **no-return [Travelling Salesmen Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Special_cases)**. Solving this will result in a sequence of books that embodies the lowest total semantic difference between neighbouring books. It makes the _most sense,_ in ways that are not just affiliated with the title or the author, or even the genre, but the fundamental _concept_ of that book _._ Having generated embeddings, solving this problem is easy in `optimal-bookshelf`. Just run the command `bookshelf tsp.`

For visualisation purposes, you can also solve a TSP over embeddings that have first been reduced to two dimensions. The easiest and generally most effective way to do this in situations where the meaning isn't too important ([alert they can be misleading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06910#:~:text=Despite%20their%20usefulness%2C%20t%2DSNE,non%2Dexperts%20in%20dimensionality%20reduction.)) is to use [t-SNE](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf). Running `bookshelf tsp -v `(for visual) first uses t-SNE to reduce the dimension of the embeddings, and then solves the reduced dimension TSP (as the TSP relies on a distance matrix it scales with number of points and not dimensionality) resulting in the following:

It's really interesting to follow the path and see themes emerging based on author or publication date, or even if the book is read, unread, or in progress, though I'm choosing to keep secret and just label the titles. It all acts like a constellation of my reading interests and habits, similar to the manually created constellation of artists at the Tate Liverpool.

I think an interesting extension would be to specify a certain number of shelves, then solve the TSP for a corresponding number of lines equal to the available shelves. In theory I have the number of pages in each book available, so I could add a physical packing constraint here to ensure all the books fit. For full transparency, here's my current optimal shelf based on this semantic TSP. Spot the various threads that emerge…

I think another next logical step would be to build in a recommendation tool based on the vector embeddings and maybe even the resulting TSP solutions. This would potentially result in a bi-level integer program (hard) depending on what you deem most important (add a book that would fit most optimally within a current collection of books, or add a book that would result in the most added distance to the resulting optimal semantic tour?), but with a small enough number candidates this could be solved without approximation. We will see.

Was it worth it? Perhaps the lesson in all of this is that fulfilment lies not in choosing between chaos and order, but in finding systems that embrace both—straddling each paradigm, allowing us to be both the organised librarian and to take a book for a walk.

As I've quoted before, Donella Meadows states in her book _Thinking in Systems: A Primer:_

> There is yet one leverage point that is even higher than changing a paradigm. That is to keep oneself unattached in the arena of paradigms, to stay flexible, to realize that no paradigm is "true", that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding of an immense and amazing universe that is far beyond human comprehension.
