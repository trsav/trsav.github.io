The Olympics are a celebration of human physical achievement. But I simply don't believe some of the sports should be in it^[Said with absolutely zero authority]. In this post, I present a manifesto, a set of criteria that will define what an Olympic sport should be. I will then use this model to rank the sports in the 2024 Olympics, and see if they pass the test. 

The conclusions presented should be taken with mountains of salt^[This couldn't be stressed enough]. I am in no way qualified to make these judgements, and I wouldn't even say these represent my actual opinions. In effect this post is completely useless, a waste of time, and I'm sorry for making it^[Pathetic].

### Executive Summary

<br>


- **Triathalon** and **Weightlifting** are the pinnacle of Olympic sports.
- **Football** and **Breakdancing** should be removed from the Olympics with immediate effect.
- **Darts** should be added to the Olympics.

In my opinion^[A note on darts, I don't actually substanciate this claim at all, it is just something I believe deeply in. Apologies for the clickbait.], after intense internal discussion with close friends and family, I have settled on the following three criteria that define a real Olympic sport:

1. Is winning the Olympics the pinnacle of the sport?
1. Is the sport hard?
    - Does it look physically difficult, could anyone compete (at any level)?
2. Are there judges?
    - Is the sport subjective?

To generate these rankings, I unashamedly used a large-language model to give me a CSV based on these criteria, making the rest of the analysis in this post, in effect, invalid.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd 

df = pd.read_csv('sports.csv')
```


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 1

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

# sort df rows by df['Difficulty'] + df['Judging Requirement'] + df['Olympic Pinnacle']

# df = df.sort_values(by='Judging Requirement',ascending=False)

df['Judging Requirement'] = 10 - df['Judging Requirement']

df['Score'] = df['Difficulty'] + df['Judging Requirement'] + df['Olympic Pinnacle']

df = df.sort_values(by='Score',ascending=False)

# reverse judging requirement (0-10 to 10-0)


fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(8,3))
ax.bar(df['Sport'],df['Difficulty'],color='k',alpha=0.5,label='Difficulty')
ax.bar(df['Sport'],df['Judging Requirement'], bottom=df['Difficulty'],color='tab:red',alpha=0.5,label='Objective Judging')
ax.bar(df['Sport'],df['Olympic Pinnacle'],bottom=df['Judging Requirement']+df['Difficulty'],color='tab:blue',alpha=0.5,label='Pinnacle?')
# rotate xticks
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

ax.legend(frameon=False)
# remove top and right axis
plt.show()

```


The bottom five sports are:
- Golf
- Equestrian
- Skateboarding
- Football
- Breaking(/Dance)

As a quick validation, let's try to justify our preference model.

- Golf: Not the pinnacle of the sport (Masters, US Open, etc.), not hard (large amount of people play).
- Equestrian: Not hard (requires sitting on a horse), relatively subjective (judged on form).
- Skateboarding: Not the pinnacle of the sport (X-Games, generally judged on whether you make a cool video), not hard (anyone can skateboard in a few weeks).

The assumption here is that my criteria are equally weighted. To investigate the robustness of this assumption, I will use Monte Carlo sampling to investigate different criteria ratios, and evaluate the resulting rankings of Olympic-ness.


```{python}
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Monte Carlo Simulation"
import numpy as np
import joypy
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.cm as cm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# matrix of scores 
scores = np.array([df['Difficulty'],df['Judging Requirement'],df['Olympic Pinnacle']]).T

# save ranks for each weighting
sampled_ranks = []
for i in range(1000):
    weights = np.random.uniform(1,3,3)
    all_scores = np.dot(scores,weights)
    ranks = np.argsort(-all_scores)
    sampled_ranks.append(ranks)


# Create a DataFrame for joypy
sampled_ranks = np.array(sampled_ranks)

joy_data = pd.DataFrame(sampled_ranks, columns=df['Sport'])

# Create the ridgeline plot
joypy.joyplot(
    data=joy_data,
    overlap=4,
    colormap=cm.Blues_r,
    labels=df['Sport'],
    title="",
    figsize=(7, 9),
);
```

We see a few interesting clusters of sports. I won't discuss them here, but there is an interesting gap between Athletics and Beach Volleyball, and later between Table Tennis and Archery, but these sports are still all comfortably in the top half of the rankings.


To try and explain some of these distributions, I'll look into how different specific differences in the criteria weights affect the rankings in a leave-one-out manner.


```{python}
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Leave-one-out Criteria Analysis"

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming df is already defined and contains the necessary data
scores = np.array([df['Difficulty'], df['Judging Requirement'], df['Olympic Pinnacle']]).T
weights = np.array([1, 1, 1])
all_scores = np.dot(scores, weights)
ranks = np.argsort(all_scores)
df = df.iloc[ranks].reset_index(drop=True)
ranks = np.arange(1, len(ranks) + 1)

def calculate_ranks(weights):
    return len(scores) - np.argsort(np.dot(scores, weights))

ranks_no_diff = calculate_ranks([0, 1, 1])
ranks_no_judges = calculate_ranks([1, 0, 1])
ranks_no_pinnacle = calculate_ranks([1, 1, 0])

def find_extreme_differences(ranks1, ranks2):
    diff = ranks1 - ranks2
    return np.argmax(diff), np.argmin(diff)

p_no_diff, n_no_diff = find_extreme_differences(ranks, ranks_no_diff)
p_no_judges, n_no_judges = find_extreme_differences(ranks, ranks_no_judges)
p_no_pinnacle, n_no_pinnacle = find_extreme_differences(ranks, ranks_no_pinnacle)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(7,6))
x = np.arange(len(df))

for ax in axs:
    ax.plot(x, ranks, color='k', label='Equal Weight')
    ax.set_xticks(x)
    if ax == axs[-1]:
        ax.set_xticklabels(df['Sport'], rotation=90, ha='right')
    else:
        ax.set_xticklabels([])

axs[0].plot(x, ranks_no_diff, color='tab:red', label='No Difficulty Criteria')
axs[0].annotate(df['Sport'][p_no_diff], (x[p_no_diff], ranks_no_diff[p_no_diff]), 
                xytext=(0, -4), textcoords='offset points', ha='center', va='top', color='tab:red')

axs[1].annotate(df['Sport'][n_no_judges], (x[n_no_judges], ranks_no_judges[n_no_judges]), 
                xytext=(0, 4), textcoords='offset points', ha='center', va='bottom', color='tab:blue')

axs[2].plot(x, ranks_no_pinnacle, color='tab:green', label='No Pinnacle Criteria')
axs[2].annotate(df['Sport'][p_no_pinnacle], (x[p_no_pinnacle], ranks_no_pinnacle[p_no_pinnacle]),

for ax in axs:
    ax.grid(alpha=0.3)
    ax.legend(frameon=False)

    ax.set_xlim(-0.5, len(df) - 0.5)

Got bored, will finish later^[I won't].
