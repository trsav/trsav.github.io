PROJECT: YOKO ONO MUSIC OF THE MIND
DESCRIPTION: Spanning more than seven decades, YOKO ONO: MUSIC OF THE MIND is the UK’s largest exhibition celebrating key moments in Ono’s groundbreaking, influential and multidisciplinary career, from the mid-1950s to now – including her years in London where she met her future husband and longtime collaborator John Lennon.

The show traces the development of her practice and explores some of Ono’s most talked about and powerful artworks and performances. This includes Cut Piece (1964), where people were invited to cut off her clothing, to her banned Film No.4 (Bottoms) (1966-67) which she created as a ‘petition for peace’. Visitors are invited to take part in both simple acts of the imagination and active encounters with Ono’s works, such as Wish Trees for London, where visitors can contribute personal wishes for peace.

Audiences will discover over 200 works including instruction pieces, scores, installations, films, music and photography. The exhibition reveals a groundbreaking approach to language, art and participation that continues to speak to the present moment.

IMAGE DESCRIPTION: The image shows a woman with long, dark hair wearing a black coat. She is holding what appears to be a wooden walking stick or cane. The black and white photograph creates a striking, somber tone. The woman has a serious expression on her face as she gazes directly at the camera. The image has a thoughtful, introspective quality to it.

EXPLANATION: The exhibition highlights Yoko Ono's groundbreaking approach to audience participation and engagement, inviting visitors to actively encounter and contribute to her artworks.
