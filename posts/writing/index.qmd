I started this blog two years ago because I wanted to discover my own personal writing style, or figure out if I even liked writing in the first place. 
At the time I remember hearing^[This could have been fully hallucinated but that doesn't matter] that the only way to get better is to write more^[Something that I always used to say about getting better at darts during my stint as President of the University of Manchester Darts Society, again probably unfounded].

This blog has evolved alongside myself throughout the last few years. 
I originally wrote about _anything_: topics related to optimisation, machine learning, or just basic tutorials on plotting graphs.
To maintain motivation, I discovered it was important to write about things that I found personally interesting and by extension would enjoy reading. 
This was my heuristic for the first 3-4 months, write what I would want to read.

As I would talk about what I wrote about to friends, we would discuss extensions, how the themes related to books we'd read, or items in the news. 
Eventually what I found interesting to read evolved, and with it what I wrote about. 
It was a cycle of reflection that led to something that I consider no longer an exercise in writing, but a fully-fledged platform for self-expression.
I believe this form self-expression will be an increasingly important ability as people shun large easy-to-attach-to socially acceptable causes in favour of a more personal way of understanding others. In effect the ability to answer the question: _what do **you** believe in?_

Why is this important?
After a year or so I realised that a lot of what I found interesting to read^[And by extension write about] was centered around _values_.
Either an explicit description of where values^[Western or otherwise] originate from^[Even if the majority of people do not appreciate this], or biographies of people who have embodied a set of values^[Whether or not you agree that they are 'correct'.].
Looking back I can point to two discussions where this focus on values seemed to emerge. 
The first was when an academic and mentor at Imperial College encouraged me to think deeper about what I stand for. 
He had served in the British Army before becoming an academic and has one of the most impressive and personally respected careers of anyone I met at Imperial.
He spoke about joining the Army post-PhD and immediately being given a set of values that he has never lost. 
It doesn't even matter what they are^[You can look these up easily], but it was the idea of standing for _something_, and demonstrating intention when planning and executing a mission^[Used both literally and figuratively] with them in mind. 
It doesn't just give you the confidence to succeed but demonstrates to others that you are serious.
When someone like that tells you he doesn't know what _you_ stand for, you start to think a bit deeper about how to live your life.

The second experience was just after reading Dominion by Tom Holland, which I'd bought at random from a charity shop in Paddington. I ended up playing cricket at the same time as him every week at The Oval, and after a few weeks built up the courage to tell him that I very much enjoyed his book and it encouraged me to write and think about my own values more. He was of course extremely gracious^[Embodying the very values he writes about in a classic move]. This experience brought it all much closer to home. I realised that you _were_ allowed to discuss and think on a deeper level about why you do things. You _can_ choose to believe in a correct way of living, and disagree with those whose beliefs are at odds with that. Though if one of your beliefs is tolerance and respecting others as equals then disagreement should be purely academic in sense^[In my opinion.].

In light of the shift in focus of this blog, and aligning with the increasingly popular idea that you should _own_ the values you consider correct, I will use the remainder of this post to outline my values, what has influenced them, how they developed, and where I've written about them before^[Consciously or not].

I don't think it's fair to load the values that I'll present below with a definition or a word. They are more easily defined by my experiences, books, and writing. It wouldn't do them justice to summarise them in an easily digestible way. Values shouldn't be easily digestible, that would render them light and meaningless. Values should be _heavy_. You would, and _should_ have to read the same books, experience the same emotions, go to the same places and have the same discussions in exactly the same order to fully understand them. But that's life, and that's how I think values should be.

I am unashamedly a Baillie Gifford^[The prize not the investment manager] fan. I've found it to be a relatively good heuristic for what to read. Plus if you read 24 books a year over 30 years you'll only ever read about 700 books, which seems oddly small for a lifetime. Probably a small-ish sized room walls worth of books.
If I see a shortlisted sticker then it gets weighted a little more strongly in my head, the Restless Republic being one of these. 
It recounts the years where Britain was a republic between the violent death of King Charles I, and General Monck's march for restoration. 
Told through the lens of a few individuals, in my opinion it highlights the role that individuals serve in building and destroying institutions and how people respond to these changes.

I read Going to Church in Medieval England shortly after.
Set in the 400 year period before the republic, to me it highlighted how institutions form lasting societal impressions, that are generally under appreciated by the population. 
It breaks down every aspect of what it would have been like to attend church, and the developments that have stemmed as a result, or been lost^[For example timekeeping and clocks, first appearing on church towers to indicate when mass was, as opposed to the often inconvenient sun-based system, particularly in the winter.]. The Britain that this book leaves behind is one that feeds into the Restless Republic. 
One where institutions have been dismantled but their traditions broadly remain. Read in series these two books highlight how values are built up and enforced by institutions, and what happens when the rug is pulled underneath them. 

Pandaemonium 1660-1886 follows on from the Britain that is left in the Restless Republic. It charts the Industrial Revolution entirely through eyewitness accounts. Similarly, I came away with an appreciation for the individual's responsibility and ability to drive change, and how this can occur in an often quiet and understated setting. 
This book represents the purest form experiencing this change, unaffected by stylistic choices, and is commonly said to be read like a film or a montage of the event itself, as opposed to a retelling.

Going back I would read these three books in chronological order. The combined story they tell is one that begins with a nation of farmers and bishops, and through the individual, ends with Britain as an industrial and economic superpower with the world's strongest democracy. 
They have provided me with what I consider a good overview of how Britain was built over the last 800 years, by people working quietly away, unburdened by what has been.
Institutions are built by great people who don't stop to consider if they could, and they are brought down in periods of boredom by those who don't consider if they should. They highlight how change happens, and how humans naturally respond. These aren't necessarily values in and of themselves, but to me capture the feeling and need to progress.

A common theme that I experienced when thinking about scientific or creative progress are feedback loops or cycles. 
People naturally inspire each other, and I found myself experiencing this in a number of settings. 

I picked up a copy of The Creative Act by Rick Rubin with an Amazon voucher shortly after it was first published. 
There is a great section where he discusses a period where The Beatles and the Beach Boys both inspired each other to produce great art (Rubber Soul and Pet Sounds), neither of which may have existed without the other. 

I encountered a similar theme in preparation for writing my PhD, where I read a few studies on knowledge discovery and reasoning. Reasoning has been separated into deductive or inductive approaches where knowledge either stems from observations (i.e. data-driven) or from first principles (i.e. physics-first). 
As machine learning became more prevalant, in science and engineering there has been the great debate as to whether neural networks or data-driven models can fully replace first-principles simulations. These are the same debates that were held in principle thousands of years ago. 
Some choose to ignore the nuance in the debate and simply combine both paradigms (i.e. hybrid modelling) forgoing logical consistency in favour of improved metrics. 
What I believe, and that I think was presented best by Thomas Kuhn, is that it is the _tension_ between inductive and deductive reasoning that drives scientific discovery. 
I articulated this point in my post on [_Machine Learning and Discovery_](https://sav.phd/posts/manifesto/). In it I discuss Mikuláš of Kadaň and Kepler. The first who built an accurate astronomical clock based on incorrect observations, the second deriving the correct first principles for planetary motion, partly^[As the story goes] inspired by the astronomical clock. Neither existing without the other.

Finally, I read both 1599 and Super-Infinite at a very similar time of year. 1599 charts a year^[Guess] in the artistic and personal life of William Shakespeare, with an analysis of the cultural events surrounding the plays he produced this year (Julius Caesar, Henry IV etc.), while Super-Infinite presents a biography of the love poet and dean of St Pauls Cathedral John Donne, similarly told through his work. 
Like my encounter with Tom Holland, living in London (and being raised in an area near Stratford-upon-Avon) both books resonated with me because of the immediacy of the locations, and the ability for the city to maintain a deep sense of history. I regularly see and experience locations, streets and buildings from both books. 
Both Shakespeare and John Donne would have lived in the same London at the same time, with each book mentioning the other writer/poet as a contemporary character. 
While there's no concrete evidence that they did meet, read together both books paint a scene of a London with literary and theatrical scene where people are constantly responding, reacting, and trying to improve on others. Shakespeare for example killing off beloved character Falstaff as a symbolic gesture to demand more intellectual engagement from his audience, or John Donne introducing readers to metaphysics. 
For me, these cycles of inspiration and expression are what drives progress. I consider it important to listen to, learn from, and improve on others.

In early 2024 I visited Istanbul and [wrote about](https://sav.phd/posts/values/) how people have historically imposed values, how people have approached experiencing others values, and how this relates to steering LLMs. 
Istanbul seemed to deal with these layers well to me. In recent years the Hagia Sophia was converted from a secular museum to a mosque, though in my opinion this practically meant not much and was done quite sensitively. 
A similar city to Istanbul in this sense is Jerusalem. While I've never been, Simon Sebag Montefiore's book provided me with an overview for how values and beliefs are often more layered and complex than distinct and digestible, and that there are historically better ways of dealing with this complexity. 
I read Empire of Signs before and during a trip to Japan. I wrote about it in my posts on [Japan and creative LLMs](https://sav.phd/posts/haiku/), and in my post on [cultural competition in AI](https://sav.phd/posts/llm/). In it Barthes presents an idealistic vision of Japan that holds a mirror up to our own beliefs, generally concerned with the lack of 'whole' that we focus on in the West and an increased emphasis on the in-between-ness of society, food, the arts and culture, the _zen_. Reading this book, and visiting Japan simultaneously made me appreciate the opposing and equally valid ways of looking at the world, and centering (or not centering in a Barthes-esque view of Japan) your life around your beliefs. I felt like I came away not only understanding Japan more^[With the help of my former flatmate now living in Tokyo.] but understanding my own way of living. To me it is about having respect for others and understanding how other people think, particularly if they have different or opposing values. In reality, there is no real reason for people to have a globally consistent set of values, or want to live life in the same manner. Respecting this, I believe, benefits everyone.
In _A Perfect Spy_, Magnus Pym is a fictional double agent, who no one^[Eventually they realise this] doubts would have a different ideology to themselves. He eventually runs out of room but not before explaining to the cast of other characters precisely why he did what he did. To me it is about ideologies, motivations and what _may_ happen if you take for granted the layers of beliefs that occur in the real world and is one of the best books I've ever read.

Together, these books and experiences highlight to me that people _do_ think differently to each other, sometimes in harmony with a personal set of values, and sometimes in direct opposition. On one end of the spectrum, under appreciating this can put your own beliefs at risk, but on the other end it has the capacity to cause real harm.

Finally I'll highlight two last books, a trip, and two posts. As I previously mentioned I found Tom Holland's Dominion in a charity shop in 2021 when I neither knew about him, the book, or the Rest is History podcast. Having read it and met him, it really does change the way you see the world. 
Bruce Clark's Athens accompanied me on a trip there where I made a point of reading the relevant passages at the proscribed locations. His description of what Athenians, the _demos_, would have felt like standing at the top of the Acropolis was very evocative. These people had values that they believed to be correct. You can sense the confidence that they had 2500 years later, moreso than you can in a city with a similarly layered history such as Istanbul. As Tom Holland describes, these ideas morphed into Christianity, through philosophy and gave birth to the Western world. You cannot visit the acropolis and not want to be associated with this confidence in some way^[as Elgin took too seriously]. Since experiencing Athens, and reading Dominion, I've considered the values that have resulted, that define the West, and consider them to be the correct ones. Finally, I'll describe the two pieces that I have enjoyed writing the most. The first, [an over-analysis of Wallace and Gromit from the perspective of Ancient Greek mythologies](https://sav.phd/posts/gromit/) and [an over-analysis of Ratatoille that frames him as a false prophet](https://sav.phd/posts/ratatouille/). Both are self-indulgent, but both highlight how often fun it is to think a little deeper about why we live life the way we do, and have a bit of confidence that it's the right way of experiencing the world. 

That's it for now. I think these are strong enough experiences for me to live and benefit from them, but I appreciate that people could and _should_ change^[As a belief, meta.]. I hope the half-life of this post is about a decade. As I say at the beginning, I believe values should be _heavy_ and hard to shift or sway. Maybe in ten years I'll write another version, or a reflection, but for now this is me.
